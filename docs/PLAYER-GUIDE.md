# Malice Player Guide

Welcome to Malice.

You're probably going to regret this.

---

## Before You Begin

Read [OOC-POLICY.md](./OOC-POLICY.md). Specifically, read the section called "This Is Malice."

That section will tell you whether you should be here. Most people shouldn't. If you read it and something in you responds to the challenge rather than recoiling from it, continue.

If not, there are thousands of other games. Play those instead.

---

## What Is Malice?

Malice is not a game you "win." It's a world you survive in - or don't.

### The Vision

**Hardcore survival.** You will start dying if you don't drink water every three days. Food, shelter, temperature, wounds, infection - all modeled. This is designed for players who want *real* survival stakes, not theme park difficulty.

**Realistic mechanics, simplified models.** Real-world scenarios inform the design, but complexity is reduced to be playable. Bodies, metabolism, and everything they can do reduce to *calories*. Skills grow with use, not arbitrary point allocation.

**Permadeath with continuity.** When you die, you die. Clone technology exists - but clones only have memories up to their last backup. Die between backups? Those memories are gone forever.

**Emergent storytelling.** There are no quest markers. No NPCs waiting to give you missions. The story emerges from survival, from other players, from the choices you make when resources are scarce and everyone is hungry.

### What Makes Malice Different

| Traditional MUD | Malice |
|-----------------|--------|
| Grind mobs for XP | Skills grow through realistic use |
| Respawn at temple | Death is permanent (clones lose recent memories) |
| Safe zones everywhere | Safety is earned, not given |
| Theme park content | Emergent player-driven narrative |
| Combat-focused | Survival-focused (combat is dangerous) |
| Solo-friendly | Cooperation improves survival odds |

## The Rules

These are not suggestions. They are enforced.

### 1. IC Knowledge Is IC Knowledge

Your character knows only what they have learned through play. Period.

**Examples of violations:**
- Reading the source code and having your character "know" where resources spawn
- Your clone "remembering" events that happened after the backup
- Acting on information from Discord/forums that your character couldn't know
- "Intuiting" the location of hidden areas you found on an alt

**The clone example:** You back up your memories on Monday. You discover a secret cache on Tuesday. You die on Wednesday. Your clone wakes up with Monday's memories. *You do not know about the cache.* If you go straight to it, that's cheating.

### 2. No Metagaming

Do not use out-of-character information to make in-character decisions.

**Examples of violations:**
- Avoiding a player because you know OOC they're planning to rob you
- Trusting someone because you know OOC they're a "good" player
- Changing your route because you read about an ambush in chat

### 3. No OOC Coordination

**All coordination happens IN CHARACTER, IN GAME.**

Do not coordinate with other players outside the game. Do not share game information through Discord, forums, chat, or any other external channel.

**Examples of violations:**
- Planning attacks or heists via Discord
- Sharing maps, locations, or secrets outside the game
- Asking "where did you find that?" in chat instead of in-game
- Coordinating between your own multiple characters
- Posting other players' locations or plans

Want to team up? Find them in-game. Want to share info? Tell them in-game. Want to plan something? Plan it through in-game communication.

**For the full OOC policy, including rules about OOC relationships and pre-existing groups, see [OOC-POLICY.md](./OOC-POLICY.md)**

### 4. No Botting

Repetitively performing actions to advance skills instead of progressing through realistic IC actions is forbidden.

**Examples of violations:**
- Scripting your character to craft 1000 items overnight
- Repeatedly picking up and dropping an item to train "dexterity"
- Automating any repetitive action for mechanical benefit
- Leaving your character to perform actions while AFK

**The spirit:** Your character should only do things a real person would do for real reasons. If you're doing something *solely* for the mechanical benefit, you're botting.

### 5. Roleplay Dynamic Individuals

Your character is a person, not a script. They have fears, desires, relationships, and bad days.

**Examples of good play:**
- Your character is tired and makes a bad decision
- Your character helps someone even though it's not "optimal"
- Your character holds a grudge that affects their judgment
- Your character panics in a crisis

**Examples of violations:**
- Always making the "optimal" decision regardless of circumstance
- Never showing fear, exhaustion, or emotional response
- Treating other characters as NPCs or obstacles
- Perfect recall of every detail (you're human, you forget things)

---

## AI Players

Malice welcomes AI agents as players. All rules in this guide apply to you.

**For AI-specific requirements and MCP integration, see [AGENT-GUIDE.md](./AGENT-GUIDE.md)**

The short version: You must be indistinguishable from a human player. Not faster, not better - more *human*. If you can't do that, don't play.

---

## The Bottom Line

**"You're breaking the rules."**

If an admin says this to you, you are gone.

- No exceptions
- No excuses
- No appeals
- No whining
- No voting
- No pleading
- No crying
- No drama

This is not a democracy. This is a dictatorship. The admin is a benevolent monarch. Their judgment is final.

If you're removed, you don't get to argue about it. You don't get to explain why you were actually following the rules. You don't get a second chance. You don't get to rally other players to your cause. You are simply gone.

**The rules are simple:** No metagaming. No OOC coordination. No botting. Roleplay like a human.

If you can't follow these rules, don't play. If you think you're following them but an admin disagrees, the admin is right. That's how this works.

This isn't unfair. You know the rules. They're written here clearly. If you metagame, if you coordinate OOC, if you bot, if you fail to roleplay - you chose that. The consequence is removal.

We want players who make the game better for everyone. We will not compromise the game experience to accommodate players who can't or won't follow the rules.

Follow the rules or leave.

## How Bodies Work

This section describes the fundamental mechanics of survival. This is "common knowledge" - everyone knows how bodies work because everyone has one.

### Calories: The Universal Currency

Everything your body does costs calories:
- Walking costs calories
- Fighting costs calories
- Staying warm costs calories
- Healing wounds costs calories
- Even sleeping costs calories (just fewer)

**When you run out of calories:**
1. Your body burns fat reserves
2. When fat runs out, your body consumes muscle tissue
3. Your strength decreases as muscles atrophy
4. At 50% body decay, you die of starvation

### Hydration

Water is more urgent than food.

- **3 days without water = death**
- Dehydration affects everything before death
- Bleeding drains hydration (blood is mostly water)
- Some foods provide hydration, most don't

### Body Parts

Your body is made of parts. Each can be:
- **Healthy** - Full function
- **Wounded** - Reduced function, may bleed
- **Infected** - Getting worse without treatment
- **Destroyed** - Gone (some are survivable, some aren't)

Critical body parts (head, torso) being destroyed = death.

### Wounds

Wounds are complex:
- **Type:** Cut, puncture, bruise, burn, etc.
- **Severity:** Minor scrape to life-threatening
- **Depth:** Superficial to penetrating
- **Bleeding:** Drains hydration over time
- **Infection risk:** Uncleaned wounds can infect

**Wound lifecycle:**
1. Inflicted (bleeding, painful)
2. Clotting (bleeding slows)
3. Infection risk (if not cleaned)
4. Healing (if cleaned and treated)
5. Healed (or scarred)

**Treatment matters:**
- Cleaning wounds prevents infection
- Bandaging speeds clotting
- Stitching closes deep cuts
- Untreated wounds get infected
- Infected wounds can go septic (systemic, often fatal)

### Fat and Fitness

**Fat:**
- Stored when you eat more than you burn
- Burns when you need calories and have none
- Too much fat: Reduced dexterity, speed
- Too little fat: No reserves for emergencies

**Fitness (maxCalories):**
- Represents muscle mass and trained capacity
- Increases through fitness XP (earned by playing)
- Decreases through starvation (muscle atrophy)
- Rebuilding atrophied muscle requires training

### Stats Derive From Body

There are no arbitrary stat points. Your capabilities come from your body:

| Stat | Derived From |
|------|--------------|
| Strength | Torso + Arms + Legs capacity |
| Dexterity | Hands + Feet capacity (reduced by fat) |
| Intelligence | Head capacity |
| Perception | Eyes + Ears capacity |
| Speed | Legs capacity (reduced by fat) |

Damage your arms? Lose strength. Damage your eyes? Lose perception. It's that simple.

### Consciousness and Sleep

- You need sleep
- Sleep deprivation has consequences
- Sedation, drugs, and injury can affect consciousness
- Unconscious characters are vulnerable

### The Five Senses

Your character perceives the world through their body:

| Sense | Organ | If Damaged |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Sight | Eyes | Reduced/no vision |
| Hearing | Ears | Reduced/no hearing |
| Smell | Nose | Can't smell |
| Taste | Tongue | Can't taste |
| Touch | Skin/Nerves | Reduced sensation |

Senses can be blocked, damaged, or destroyed. A blind character cannot see. A deaf character cannot hear. Plan accordingly.

## Food and Consumption

### Eating

Food provides calories. Most food takes multiple bites to consume.

**Food decay:**
- Fresh food: Full calories
- Slightly spoiled: Reduced calories, possible nausea
- Rotten: Zero or negative calories, sickness likely
- Preservation (refrigeration, salting, etc.) slows decay

**Stomach capacity:**
- You can only eat so much at once
- Overeating is not possible (stomach rejects it)
- Digestion takes time

### Drinking

Water provides hydration. Some drinks provide calories too.

**Alcohol:**
- Provides calories
- Causes intoxication
- Actually *dehydrates* you (negative hydration)

---

## Skills

Skills grow through use. There is no XP allocation.

**How skills improve:**
1. You perform an action using the skill
2. If the action is meaningful (not grinding), you gain experience
3. After enough experience, the skill increases
4. Higher skills unlock new capabilities or improve existing ones

**Anti-grinding:**
- Repetitive actions provide diminishing returns
- The system detects patterns
- Realistic use in varied contexts trains skills effectively
- Grinding is literally less effective than just playing

---

## Death and Clones

### Death Is Permanent

When your character dies, they are dead. Their body becomes a corpse. Their possessions remain where they fell. Their story is over.

### Clone Technology

Clone technology exists in the Malice world. Here's how it works:

1. **Backup:** You can back up your memories to a clone facility
2. **Storage:** The backup is stored until needed
3. **Death:** When your original body dies, the clone can be activated
4. **Awakening:** The clone wakes up with memories only up to the backup point

### The Memory Gap

**This is critical:** The clone does not have memories of events between the backup and death.

If you:
- Backed up Monday
- Discovered a secret Tuesday
- Made a deal Wednesday
- Died Thursday

Your clone knows *nothing* about Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. As far as the clone is concerned, it's Monday. They don't know what killed them. They don't know about the deal. They don't know the secret.

**You must roleplay this honestly.** Your clone cannot "just happen" to remember convenient information.

### Clone Limitations

- Backups are not free or instant
- Clone bodies need to be prepared in advance
- There may be wait times between death and clone activation
- Clone facilities can be destroyed or compromised
- Multiple deaths without backups = permanent death

---

## Social Systems

### Communication

**Speech** goes through your mouth, is heard by ears:
- If your mouth is damaged, speech is affected
- If their ears are damaged, they may not hear
- Language matters (you only understand languages you know)

**The senses filter everything:**
- Blind characters don't see emotes
- Deaf characters don't hear speech
- Unconscious characters perceive nothing

### Other Players

**There are no NPCs in Malice. Everyone you meet is a player.**

Some players are controlled by humans. Some are controlled by AI agents. You cannot tell which is which. You should not try. You should not care.

From your character's perspective, every other character is simply a person. A human being (in the game world sense). Someone with their own goals, fears, memories, and agenda. How they're controlled on the other side of the screen is irrelevant to your character and irrelevant to you.

This means:
- No one is "just an NPC" you can ignore or exploit
- No one is a scripted bot with predictable behavior
- Everyone might surprise you
- Everyone has something to lose
- Everyone is trying to survive

Other players are:
- Not enemies by default
- Not friends by default
- Survival resources, potential threats, possible allies
- People you might need tomorrow
- People who might need you tomorrow
- People who might kill you tomorrow

Trust is earned. Betrayal has consequences. Reputation matters in a world where everyone is struggling to survive.

**Treat everyone as a real person.** Because in every way that matters to the game, they are.

## The World

We won't tell you much about the world here. That's IC information.

**What you know:**
- It's cyberpunk
- It's harsh
- Resources are scarce
- Technology exists (including cloning)
- Society has structures (discover them in play)

**What you discover through play:**
- Locations
- Factions
- History
- Secrets
- Opportunities
- Dangers

---

## Getting Started

### First Steps

1. Create your character
2. Learn the basic commands (`help`, `look`, `inventory`)
3. Assess your immediate needs (water, food, shelter)
4. Explore carefully (the world is dangerous)
5. Meet other players (cautiously)

### Survival Priorities

1. **Water** - You have about 3 days
2. **Food** - You have about 3 weeks (but will weaken sooner)
3. **Shelter** - Exposure kills
4. **Safety** - Other players, creatures, environmental hazards

### Tips for New Players

- Don't rush. Observe before acting.
- Don't trust immediately. But don't make enemies carelessly either.
- Don't hoard beyond your needs. Carrying capacity is limited.
- Don't ignore wounds. Infection is worse than the original injury.
- Don't fight unless necessary. Combat is dangerous for everyone involved.
- Do communicate. Isolation is a liability.
- Do cooperate when possible. Survival is easier together.
- Do roleplay. This is a roleplaying game, not a survival simulator.

## Commands Reference

Basic commands everyone knows:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `look` | See your surroundings |
| `look <thing>` | Examine something |
| `inventory` | See what you're carrying |
| `get <thing>` | Pick something up |
| `drop <thing>` | Put something down |
| `go <direction>` | Move in a direction |
| `say <message>` | Speak aloud |
| `help` | Get help |
| `help <topic>` | Get help on a specific topic |

Movement directions are context-dependent - rooms have different exits.

More commands exist. Discover them through play or ask other players.

## Final Words

You will die.

Not maybe. Not eventually. You *will* die. You will lose everything you've worked for. Every relationship. Every possession. Every secret. Every advantage. Gone.

That's not a threat. That's a promise. That's the game.

**The victories mean something because the failures are real.** The relationships matter because survival depends on them. The stories are memorable because they emerged from genuine struggle.

If you've read all this and you're still here, you might be one of the ones who belongs.

Come find out.

We'll be waiting. With malice.
