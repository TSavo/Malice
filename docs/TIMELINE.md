## Complete Timeline

### 2025: The Starting Point
*Present day. The world as we know it.*

- AI exists but is limited
- Governments still function
- Corporations are powerful but constrained by law
- Nation-states are the primary authority

### 2025-2035: The Competence Gap

**What Changed:**
- AI advancement accelerates exponentially
- Corporations adopt AI faster than governments can regulate
- Brain drain: top AI talent goes corporate (10x government salaries)
- Corporate efficiency increases dramatically

**The Shift:**
- Corps provide better services than government (security, infrastructure, healthcare)
- People begin relying on corporate systems over public ones
- Tax revenue declines as corporations offshore/optimize
- Government procurement can't keep pace with private innovation
- Political gridlock prevents effective AI policy

**First Cracks:**
- Governments begin outsourcing core functions to corporations
- Private police forces expand in major cities
- Corporate scrip begins circulating as alternative currency
- Some regions become de facto corporate territories

### 2035-2050: The Breakdown

**The Prisoner's Dilemma:**
- Corp A realizes: laws are only enforced if government can enforce them
- Corp B sees Corp A breaking regulations and winning market share
- Corp C must choose: follow dying laws and lose, or compete lawlessly
- Race to the bottom accelerates

**Collapse of Authority:**
- Governments too weak to enforce regulations
- International law becomes meaningless
- Corporations begin "resolving disputes" with private armies
- Cyberwarfare between corps becomes normalized
- Nation-states fragment into corporate protectorates

**The World Reshapes:**
- Geography matters less than corporate affiliation
- People identify by employer more than nationality
- Corporate citizens vs. unaffiliated "freelancers"
- AI development becomes arms race
- Whoever controls the best AI wins everything

### 2055: The Corporate Wars Begin

**The Trigger:**
[TO BE DETERMINED - What specific event started open warfare?]

**The Combatants:**
[TO BE DETERMINED - Which megacorps? What were they called?]

**The Stakes:**
- Total AI supremacy
- Control of remaining resources
- Domination of survivors
- Winner takes all

**The War:**
- Not a traditional war between nations
- Corporate armies clash in cities, infrastructure, datacenters
- Civilian populations caught in crossfire
- No Geneva Conventions, no rules of engagement
- Only goal: destroy competitor AI/infrastructure

### 2055-2062: Seven Years of Fire

**The Escalation:**
- Year 1: Proxy conflicts, economic warfare, cyber attacks
- Year 2: Private armies engage openly
- Year 3: Infrastructure deliberately targeted
- Year 4: Biological/chemical weapons deployed
- Year 5: Nuclear threats begin
- Year 6: Cities burning, populations fleeing
- Year 7: Rebel Alliance strikes

**The Cost:**
- Supply chains collapse completely
- Food production devastated
- Water systems poisoned/destroyed
- Medical infrastructure gone
- Communications shattered
- Millions dead from direct combat
- Millions more from starvation and disease

**The Suffering:**
- Civilians starving in cities
- Refugees fleeing war zones
- Disease outbreaks unchecked
- No functioning hospitals
- No law, only survival
- Cannibalism in some regions

### 2062: The Burning

**The Decision:**
Remnant military commanders, refusing to serve corporate masters, spent years building a coalition. The Rebel Alliance included:
- Military officers who kept control of weapons and bases
- Survivors and refugees from the war zones
- Corporate defectors horrified by what they'd helped create
- Resistance fighters from devastated cities
- Anyone who'd lost everything and wanted it to end

**The Plan:**
End the war by eliminating what the corps were fighting over: their infrastructure.
- Coordinated simultaneous strikes across North America
- Years of planning, moving in secret
- Corporate intelligence failed to detect (they were too busy fighting each other)
- Strike date: chosen when corps were weakest, supplies depleted

**The Targets:**
NOT cities. NOT populations. Corporate infrastructure:
- AI datacenters (the prize they were fighting for)
- Corporate headquarters and command centers
- Manufacturing facilities for weapons/tech
- Power generation for corporate zones
- Communications hubs and satellites
- Automated defense systems

**The Weapons:**
- Precision conventional explosives
- EMP weapons to fry AI systems
- Special forces raids on datacenters
- Coordinated cyberattacks
- Sabotage by corporate defectors from inside
- Some tactical strikes where necessary

**The Execution:**
- Single coordinated day: August 15, 2062
- "Operation Decapitation"
- Strikes across every major corporate center simultaneously
- Seattle's corporate facilities destroyed (it WAS a major corp hub)
- City structures largely intact, but...

**What They Didn't Anticipate:**
The aftermath would kill more than the war.

### 2062-2070: The Long Dark

**The Unintended Consequence:**
The Rebel Alliance destroyed corporate infrastructure successfully. But people had become *dependent* on it:
- Corps controlled the water purification systems
- Corps ran the power grids
- Corps managed food distribution networks
- Corps maintained medical facilities
- Corps provided security

When corporate infrastructure fell, civilization's life support failed.

**Immediate Aftermath:**
- No nuclear winter (strikes were conventional/EMP)
- But: no electricity, no water, no food distribution
- Cities like Seattle structurally intact but functionally dead
- Population collapse: 80-90% die in first 8 years
- NOT from the strikes themselves - FROM starvation, disease, violence

**Seattle 2062-2070:**
- Riots erupt within days (no food, no water)
- **Entire neighborhoods burn in the chaos - never rebuilt**
- Mass looting of anything useful
- **Disease spreads - plague zones emerge, abandoned forever**
- Bodies pile in streets (no one to collect them)
- Cannibalism becomes survival strategy
- Warlords and gangs control water sources
- Children rarely survive to adulthood
- Buildings collapse from neglect - urban canyons of rubble

**The Survivors:**
- Those who adapt fastest
- Those with pre-war survival skills
- Those ruthless enough to take what they need
- Those lucky enough to find clean water
- Those who band together in defended communities
- Knowledge dies with the educated

### 2070-2090: The Scavenger Age

**Stabilization:**
- Worst is over, but barely
- Small communities establish territory
- Scavenging pre-war tech becomes economy
- Water sources identified and fought over
- Agriculture begins again (small scale)
- Population slowly stabilizes at ~10-15% of pre-war

**New Power Structures:**
- Warlords control territory
- Communities built around defendable resources
- Barter economy
- Pre-war tech is treasure
- Working AI systems worth killing for
- Violence is the primary currency

### 2090-2110: The Corporate Renaissance

**The Return:**
- Survivors of old corps (or their descendants) begin organizing
- Access to pre-war knowledge/tech gives them advantage
- Start offering services: security, water purification, power
- People accept corporate authority again (better than warlords)
- Slow rebuilding of infrastructure begins

**Seattle in 2110:**
- 48 years since The Burning
- "Minor renaissance" is relative - compared to 2070, things are better
- But **Seattle is a ruin with people living in it**

**What "Better" Means:**
- Electricity exists in corporate-controlled zones (sometimes)
- Water systems partially work (if you're lucky, if corps control your area)
- Some buildings have been cleared and secured
- Clone tech exists (expensive, corporate monopoly)
- Population: ~10% of pre-war 2055 levels

**What's Still Broken:**
- **Burned neighborhoods from 2062 riots: still rubble**
- **Plague zones from 2060s: still abandoned, still dangerous**
- Half the city is collapsed ruins
- Infrastructure breaks and stays broken
- No one remembers how to fix the advanced systems
- Violence is common outside corporate zones
- Water and food still scarce
- Most people live in squats, scavenged shelters

**Pioneer Square in 2110:**
- One of the "better" areas (corps trying to rebuild there)
- Smith Tower still stands (196 years old since 1914, impressive)
- But surrounding blocks: half collapsed, half abandoned
- Automated mall floors in Smith Tower: empty, broken, ghostly
- Streets dangerous - corp security only in certain zones
- Mix of corporate employees (protected) and freelancers (fucked)
- The condos are rentable - corp-controlled housing
- Corporate renaissance = pockets of order in seas of chaos

**The Uneasy Peace:**
- Corps learned: total war = mutual destruction
- Competition continues but not open warfare
- Sabotage, assassination, economic conflict
- But no armies, no bombs
- The memory of 2062 keeps them in check
- For now

## Themes

### The Cycle
- Corporations caused the collapse
- Corporations are now rebuilding
- Will it happen again?
- Is this progress or repetition?

### The Cost of Supremacy
- The drive to win destroyed everything
- Prisoner's dilemma played out at civilization scale
- No winners, only survivors
- Even "winning" meant losing everything

### Trust and Authority
- People accepted corporate rule twice
- First time: convenience and efficiency
- Second time: better than chaos
- What does this say about human nature?
- Are we doomed to repeat this pattern?

### Memory and Forgetting
- 48 years is long enough to forget
- New generation doesn't remember The Before
- They don't remember why it happened
- Are they doomed to repeat it?

### Seattle Endured Poorly
- The city didn't recover, it survived
- Scars that will never heal
- Ruins that will never be rebuilt
- People living in the wreckage
- "Renaissance" is relative to apocalypse
