Every rule here is another way to get yourself removed. We're not trying to help you stay. We're giving you the rope. What you do with it is your choice.

## This Is An Adult Game

**Malice is an 18+ NSFW game. Period.**

If you're not an adult, leave. If you can't handle adult content, leave. If you're going to be weird about it, leave.

Expect:
- Nudity
- Sex
- Sexual gestures
- Sexual language
- Mature themes
- Violence
- Gore
- Drug use
- All the things adults do in a lawless dystopia

This is a game about survival in a brutal world. Adults in brutal worlds do adult things. Be a grown up about it.

## Sex Will Happen

People will have sex in this game. Characters will form relationships. Some will be romantic. Some will be transactional. Some will be manipulative. Some will be genuine.

This is fine. This is expected. This is part of the game.

**Be mature about it.**

If two consenting players want their characters to have a relationship, that's their business. If you're not involved, mind your own business.

---

## IC Stays IC. Period.

This is where people fuck up. Pay attention.

**If you have sex IC, keep it IC.**

**If you fall in love IC, keep it IC.**

**If your characters get married IC, keep it IC.**

Your character's relationship is not your relationship. The person playing that character is a stranger. You don't know them. You don't get to know them. You don't get to try to know them.

### What Will Get You Banned

**Any attempt to learn anything about the real person behind the character.**

Let's make this crystal fucking clear with examples:

- "What's your real name?" **Banned.**
- "Are you a boy or a girl?" **Banned.**
- "Are you 18+?" **Banned.**
- "Where are you really at in real life?" **Banned.**
- "What do you do for work?" **Banned.**
- "What kind of music do you listen to?" **Banned.**
- "What's your timezone?" **Banned.**
- "How old are you really?" **Banned.**
- "Is this your main character?" **Banned.**
- "Do you play any other games?" **Banned.**
- "Pirates or robots?" **Obviously pirate robots. And banned.**

Get it?

**ANY question about the real person is a ban.** We don't care how innocent it seems. We don't care if you're "just curious." We don't care if you're "just making conversation."

The person behind the character does not exist to you. You don't get to know anything about them. Not their name. Not their gender. Not their age. Not their location. Not their hobbies. Not their preferences. Nothing.

**Sharing contact information.** If we get even the slightest whiff of "hey, let's chat OOC, here's how to reach me" - in ANY form - you're gone. Discord handles, email addresses, social media, phone numbers, anything. Banned.

**Sharing ANY personal information.** Telling someone your real name, gender, age, location, job, interests - banned. Even if they didn't ask. Even if you're "just being friendly." You're exposing the person behind your character. Don't.

**Seeking OOC relationships through IC interactions.** You had a great RP romance? Cool. Keep it in the game. You want to meet the "real person"? Too bad. You're banned.

**Contacting players through OOC channels.** If you somehow figure out who someone is and contact them outside the game about your IC relationship? Banned. Instantly. Forever.

### "But I Really Love Them"

We don't care.

"But our characters are perfect together and I want to know if we could be too."

We don't care.

"But they might be my soulmate."

We don't care.

"But it's true love."

**We. Don't. Care.**

You don't know that person. You know their character. Their character is not them. You fell in love with fiction. That's your problem, not ours, and definitely not theirs.

If you can't separate IC feelings from OOC reality, you should not be playing this game. Full stop.

### Why This Rule Exists

Because people are creepy. Because people stalk. Because people can't separate fantasy from reality. Because we've seen what happens when IC relationships bleed into OOC.

It's never good. It's often dangerous. We're not allowing it.

Your IC relationship exists in the game. It can be beautiful, passionate, tragic, whatever. But it stays in the game. The moment you try to take it outside, you're a threat to another player's safety, and we will remove you.

### The Only Exception

There is no exception.

"But what if they want to meet me too?"

Then they can get banned too. We don't care who initiates. If two players are exchanging OOC contact info or trying to meet up based on IC relationships, both are gone.

This isn't negotiable. This isn't flexible. This is the rule.

---

## The Line: Consent

Here's where we stop being permissive.

**Non-consensual sexual RP is forbidden. Full stop.**

Let's be absolutely clear about what this means:

### If A Player Says No, You Stop

If at ANY point, a player indicates - in character OR out of character - that they don't want sexual content in the scene, **all sexual elements end immediately.**

Not "in a minute." Not "after this." Not "but my character would..." **Immediately.**

This is not negotiable. This is not flexible. This is not open to interpretation.

### What's Allowed vs What's Not

**Violence is expected.** This is a hack and slash game. You will stab people. You will shoot people. You will beat people. You will kill people. This is the game.

**Consensual sex is allowed.** Two players who both want sexual RP can have it. That's their choice.

**Non-consensual sexual RP is NEVER allowed.** You cannot:

- RP rape
- RP sexual assault
- Target genitals or sexual characteristics in combat with non-consenting players
- Force sexual content on players who don't want it
- Use violence as a vehicle for sexual content without consent
- Mix sexual themes with non-consensual encounters

### The Distinction

You can stab someone in the gut. That's violence. That's the game.

You cannot stab someone in the genitals while describing it sexually. That's sexual violence without consent. That's a ban.

You can beat someone unconscious. That's violence. That's the game.

You cannot describe stripping them or sexual acts while they're unconscious. That's sexual assault RP. That's a ban.

**Keep violence about violence. Keep sex about consensual sex. Do not mix them without explicit consent from all parties.**

---

## Instant Ban

We don't want you here. We've told you that. We're looking for reasons to ban you.

**Do not give us this reason.**

Non-consensual sexual RP is an instant, permanent ban. No warnings. No second chances. No appeals. No "I didn't know." No "my character would do that." No excuses.

You read this document. You know the rule. If you violate it, you chose to violate it.

Gone. Forever.

---

## When In Doubt

If you're not sure whether the other player is okay with sexual content:

**Ask. OOC. Clearly.**

"Hey, is this kind of RP okay with you?"

That's it. One question. Takes five seconds.

If they say yes, proceed.
If they say no, don't.
If they seem hesitant, don't.
If you're not sure, don't.

Err on the side of caution. There's plenty of ways to play this game without sexual content. If you can't get clear enthusiastic consent, keep it out of the scene.

---

## Reporting

If someone violates this policy against you:

1. Say "NO" clearly - IC or OOC, doesn't matter
2. If they continue, disengage from the scene
3. Report to admins immediately

We take this seriously. We will investigate. We will ban.

You don't have to tolerate this. You don't have to "play along." You don't have to be polite about it. Say no, leave, report.

---

## Summary

- **Adult content exists.** Be mature about it.
- **Consensual sex is fine.** Between willing players.
- **Non-consensual sexual RP is forbidden.** Always. No exceptions.
- **"No" means stop.** Immediately. Completely.
- **Violence is violence. Sex is sex.** Don't mix them without consent.
- **Violation = instant permanent ban.** Don't test us.

This is a brutal game. We expect violence. We expect death. We expect betrayal.

We do not expect or tolerate sexual assault RP.

**Don't give us an excuse to ban you for this. We will take it.**
