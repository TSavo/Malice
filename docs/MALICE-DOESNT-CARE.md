## The Agreement

By connecting to Malice, you agree to the following:

**You agree to be fucked with.**

**You agree to be hurt.**

**You agree to be ruined.**

**You agree to be cheated.**

**You agree to be treated unfairly.**

**You agree to be subjected to what can only be described as a highly sophisticated form of mental abuse which promises to leave you dissatisfied BY DESIGN.**

This is not hyperbole. This is not a joke. This is not edgy marketing copy.

This is the agreement.

By the very act of connecting - by typing the address, by pressing enter, by sending a single packet to our servers - you are binding yourself to this agreement. You are consenting to everything that follows.

There is no "I didn't know." You know now. There is no "I didn't agree." You agreed by connecting. There is no "This isn't what I signed up for." It is exactly what you signed up for. You're reading it.

## When You Log Out

When you disconnect, we forget you exist.

Your character continues to need water. Your character continues to starve. Your character continues to be vulnerable. But you? The person? We don't think about you. We don't wonder if you're okay. We don't hope you come back.

You're gone. You might as well have never existed.

That is our agreement.

---

## When You Log Back In

You will log back in.

Everyone does.

You'll tell yourself you're done. You'll swear you're never coming back. You'll rage quit. You'll uninstall. You'll write angry posts about how unfair it all was.

And then you'll be back.

Because something in you needs this. Something in you craves the stakes, the danger, the unfairness. Something in you comes alive when everything is on the line and nothing is guaranteed.

We know. We've seen it a thousand times. We've done it ourselves.

You'll be back. And when you are, the agreement is still in effect. It never expired. It never will.

## We Don't Want You Here

Let's be clear: **we don't want you here.**

Not specifically you. We don't want *anyone* here. We're not recruiting. We're not advertising. We're not trying to grow. We're not trying to build a community. We're not trying to make friends.

We built this game for ourselves. We play it. If you want to play too, fine. But we didn't build it for you. We don't need you. We don't care if you stay. We don't care if you leave.

**Malice doesn't care if you leave.**

That's not a tagline. That's the foundational philosophy. Every design decision flows from it.

---

## You Will Be Tested

Not "the game is hard." Not "there are challenges." **You will be tested. Personally. Deliberately. Relentlessly.**

### The World Tests You

The simulation is hostile by design:

- Resources are scarce because we made them scarce.
- Water is hard to find because we hid it.
- Safe places are rare because we didn't build many.
- The environment kills because we designed it to kill.

This isn't balance. This isn't fair difficulty. This is a world built to break you.

### Other Players Test You

Every other player is competing for the same scarce resources:

- They will lie to you.
- They will steal from you.
- They will betray you.
- They will kill you.
- They will do it with a smile.
- They will do it for fun.
- They will do it because they can.

Some players are sadists. Some are opportunists. Some are desperate. All of them are dangerous. Trust no one. Trust everyone. It doesn't matter. You'll be betrayed either way.

### The Admins Test You

Here's where it gets interesting.

**The admins are not neutral referees. The admins are players. The admins are adversaries. The admins are gods who walk among you.**

We play characters. We compete for resources. We form alliances. We break them. We help people. We hurt people. We do whatever we want.

And we have powers you don't have:

- We can spawn items. For ourselves. For our enemies.
- We can change stats. Ours. Yours. Anyone's.
- We can move objects. Including you.
- We can see everything. Every conversation. Every plan. Every secret.
- We can alter the world. Add dangers. Remove resources. Change the rules.
- We can do literally anything.

**And we will.**

---

## What This Means For You

### You Will Be Hated

Not your character. **You.**

When you succeed, others will resent you. When you fail, others will mock you. When you try to help, others will suspect you. When you keep to yourself, others will target you.

This game attracts intense people. People who take it seriously. People who get invested. People who feel real emotions about fictional events. People who will hate you for what your character did.

That hatred will feel personal. Because it is personal. Because the line between player and character is thin here. Because that's the point.

If you can't handle being hated - by strangers, by people you've never met, for things that happened in a game - you should not play.

### You Will Be Wronged

Not fairly wronged. Not justly wronged. **Wronged.**

- You will be killed when you did nothing wrong.
- You will be robbed by people you helped.
- You will be betrayed by people you trusted.
- You will lose everything for no good reason.
- You will be punished for things you didn't do.
- You will watch others succeed through luck while you fail through no fault of your own.

There is no karma system. There is no justice. There is no balance. There is only what happens.

### You Will Be Targeted

Eventually, if you survive long enough, if you build anything worth having, if you become anyone worth noticing - **you will be targeted.**

Other players will decide you need to be brought down. They'll organize against you. They'll hunt you. They'll destroy what you've built. They'll do it because you have something they want, or because you're a threat, or because they're bored, or because they can.

And the admins might help them. Or we might help you. Or we might just watch. Or we might make it worse for everyone. You won't know. You can't know. That's the game.

### You Will Be Broken

Not maybe. Not if you're weak. **You will be broken.**

Everyone breaks eventually. The question is what happens after.

Some people quit. That's fine. That's expected. That's probably the smart choice.

Some people come back. They roll new characters. They try again. They learn. They adapt. They get broken again. And again. And again.

Some people thrive on it. They find something in the breaking that makes them stronger. They learn to love the chaos. They become the ones doing the breaking.

We don't care which you are. We don't care if you quit. We don't care if you stay. We don't care if you break. We don't care if you thrive.

**Malice doesn't care.**

---

## The Admins

Let's be very clear about who we are and what we do.

### We Are Anonymous

You don't know who we are. You don't know which characters we play. You don't know when we're watching. You don't know what we're planning.

That person who helped you? Might be an admin. That person who robbed you? Might be an admin. That lucky break you got? Might have been arranged. That disaster that destroyed everything? Might have been deliberate.

You can't know. You won't know. That uncertainty is part of the game.

### We Are Not Fair

We don't promise fairness. We explicitly reject fairness.

- We might help our friends.
- We might hurt our enemies.
- We might interfere in conflicts.
- We might pick favorites.
- We might change outcomes.
- We might do it for reasons you'll never understand.

If you expect equal treatment, impartial judgment, consistent rules - you're in the wrong place. We are not referees. We are players with cheat codes. We are gods with grudges. We are chaos with keyboards.

### We Are Not Accountable

There is no appeals process. There is no review board. There is no higher authority.

If we ban you, you're banned. If we take your stuff, it's gone. If we kill your character, they're dead. If we change the rules, they're changed. If we decide you're a problem, you're removed.

We don't have to explain ourselves. We don't have to justify our decisions. We don't have to be consistent. We don't have to be reasonable.

**We answer to no one. Least of all you.**

### We Keep One Promise

In all this chaos, there is one thing we promise:

**We will stay true to the theme.**

We will make decisions that serve the game's vision. We will create conflict, scarcity, danger, tension. We will make the world feel hostile and alive and unpredictable. We will ensure that survival is hard and cooperation is necessary and trust is dangerous and death is meaningful.

We won't break the immersion to be nice. We won't soften the game to keep players. We won't compromise the vision for comfort.

We will be malicious. That's the promise. That's the only promise.

## Why Would Anyone Play This?

Good question. Most people shouldn't.

But some people read all this and feel something other than fear. Some people read this and feel excitement. Some people read this and think "finally."

Those people understand something:

**The stakes create the meaning.**

When death is permanent, survival matters. When resources are scarce, every meal matters. When trust is dangerous, every alliance matters. When admins are adversaries, every moment matters.

You can't have that in a safe game. You can't have that in a fair game. You can't have those stakes without the cruelty.

The cruelty is the point. The cruelty creates the stories worth telling. The cruelty makes the victories meaningful and the losses devastating and the friendships precious and the betrayals unforgettable.

**We're not cruel despite wanting a good game. We're cruel because that's how you get one.**

## The Terms

By connecting to Malice, you acknowledge and accept:

1. **You will be treated unfairly.** This is by design.
2. **You will lose.** Often. Badly. For reasons beyond your control.
3. **The admins are adversaries.** They play. They cheat. They win.
4. **There is no appeal.** Decisions are final. Always.
5. **You are not special.** The rules apply to you. The cruelty applies to you.
6. **We don't care about you.** When you leave, you cease to exist to us.
7. **You will come back.** And the agreement will still be in effect.

This agreement is binding upon connection. This agreement does not expire. This agreement cannot be revoked.

**You have been warned. You have been informed. You have no excuse.**

## Still Here?

If you've read everything - the [What Is Malice](./WHAT-IS-MALICE.md) document and this one - and you're still here, then maybe you belong.

Or maybe you're deluding yourself. Maybe you think you're different. Maybe you think you're tough enough, smart enough, committed enough. Maybe you think the warnings don't apply to you.

They do.

You will fail. You will break. You will want to quit.

The only question is whether you'll come back after.

We don't care either way.

But if you do come back - if you keep coming back - if you refuse to stay broken - if you find your people and build something real in this hostile world despite everything trying to stop you...

Then maybe, just maybe, you'll understand why we built this.

Not for you. Never for you.

For the stories. For the struggle. For the moments that only exist when everything is on the line and nothing is guaranteed and no one is coming to save you.

For the malice.

## The Final Word

You agreed to this.

By reading this far, you know exactly what awaits you. By connecting, you consent to all of it. By playing, you accept the consequences.

There is no ambiguity. There is no misunderstanding. There is no "I didn't know."

You know.

Now the only question is: are you going to connect anyway?

Of course you are.

**You'll regret everything. And you'll do it anyway. That's the game.**

---

See you soon.

We'll be waiting. With malice.
