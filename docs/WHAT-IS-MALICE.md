## The Short Version

Malice is a **hardcore survival cyberpunk roleplaying game** where:

- **Death is permanent.** Your character dies, they're dead. Roll again.
- **Time is real.** The world doesn't pause. Your body needs water whether you're logged in or not.
- **Bodies are simulated.** Calories, hydration, wounds, infection, metabolism - all modeled after reality.
- **Roleplay is mandatory.** You're not playing a game. You ARE your character.
- **Other players are human.** Every person you meet is another player. No NPCs. No quest-givers. No safety nets.

If any of those things sound like a problem, this isn't your game. There are thousands of other games out there. Go play one of those.

## The Theme: Cyberpunk Survival

Malice is set in a **near-future dystopia** where:

- Corporations rule. Governments are facades.
- Technology is advanced but unequally distributed.
- The streets are dangerous. Trust is a commodity.
- Clone technology exists, but it's not a free respawn.
- Resources are scarce. People kill for water.

This isn't bright neon cyberpunk where you're a cool hacker in a leather jacket. This is **survival cyberpunk**. Think the worst parts of Blade Runner, The Road, and Escape from New York combined.

You're not a hero. You're not special. You're a person trying not to die in a world that wants you dead.

## What "Hardcore" Means

Let's be very fucking clear about what we mean by **hardcore**:

### The World Doesn't Stop

**Real time. Always.**

Your character exists in the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The simulation runs whether you're logged in or not. Your body burns calories while you sleep. Your wounds fester while you're at work. Your hydration drops while you're living your real life.

**Didn't log in for three days? Your character died of dehydration. Fuck you, roll a new one.**

This isn't a game you play when you feel like it. This is a **commitment**. Four hours a day, every day. Or you make arrangements - in character - so your character doesn't die while you're away. Find shelter. Stockpile water. Make allies who will watch over you. Build something sustainable.

Or don't. Die in a gutter. Feed the rats.

**We're fine with that. We expect it.**

### Your Body Is Simulated

This isn't "you have 100 HP." Your body is modeled after reality:

- **Calories**: Everything costs energy. Walking, fighting, healing, staying warm, even sleeping. Run out? Your body burns fat. Run out of fat? Your body consumes muscle. Your strength drops. Keep starving? You die.
- **Hydration**: Three days without water and you're dead. Bleeding drains hydration. Alcohol dehydrates you.
- **Body parts**: Each part can be healthy, wounded, infected, or destroyed. Damage your arms? Lose strength. Damage your eyes? Lose sight. Damage your head? Dead.
- **Wounds**: Cuts, punctures, burns - each has depth, severity, bleeding rate, infection risk. Untreated wounds get infected. Infections go septic. Sepsis kills.
- **Temperature**: Too cold? You burn calories faster. Too hot? You dehydrate faster. No shelter? Good luck.

**Don't eat for three weeks? You'll start regretting it long before then.** Your body will eat itself. Your muscles will atrophy. You'll get weaker and weaker until you can't defend yourself, can't run, can't fight. Then you'll die. Then the rats will eat you.

### We Expect You To Fail

Read that again. **We expect you to fail.**

Your first character will probably die. Your second character will probably die. You'll make mistakes. You'll trust the wrong person. You'll forget to drink. You'll get an infection you can't treat. You'll starve because you didn't plan ahead.

This is fine. This is the game.

The question isn't whether you'll fail. The question is what you'll learn from it. The question is whether you'll come back and try again. The question is whether you'll adapt.

### You Cannot Survive Alone

Here's the secret most people learn too late: **you need other people.**

Solo players die. Every time. Eventually. The math doesn't work. You can't stay awake forever. You can't watch your own back. You can't gather enough resources alone. You can't heal your own wounds when you're unconscious.

**Seek help. Lots of it. In character.**

Find allies. Make deals. Join groups. Trade favors. Build relationships. Beg if you have to. Do whatever it takes to not be alone.

Trust is dangerous. People will betray you. But isolation is death. Pick your poison.

The most successful players aren't the strongest or the smartest. They're the ones who build networks. They're the ones who make themselves valuable to others. They're the ones who understand that in a world where everyone is struggling to survive, cooperation is the only edge that matters.

### Death Has Consequences

When you die:
- Your body becomes a corpse. Your stuff stays on it. Someone will take it.
- If you have a clone backup, you wake up with memories only up to the backup point.
- Everything between your last backup and death is **gone forever**.
- No backup? That character is gone. Forever.

Die on Tuesday when your last backup was Monday? Your clone doesn't know what happened Tuesday. You discovered a secret? Gone. Made a deal? Gone. Learned someone was going to betray you? Gone.

**You must roleplay this honestly.** No "magically remembering" convenient information.

### No Hand-Holding

There are no:
- Quest markers
- Tutorial zones
- Safe areas
- Easy modes
- NPC helpers
- Guaranteed resources
- Second chances
- Pause buttons
- Sympathy

You start with nothing. You figure it out or you die. Probably both.

## What "Roleplay Enforced" Means

Malice is a **roleplaying** game. Not a survival simulator with chat. A **roleplaying** game.

### You ARE Your Character

When you log in, you're not "playing" a character. You **are** your character.

- Your character doesn't know they're in a game.
- Your character has fears, hopes, memories, relationships.
- Your character makes mistakes, gets tired, acts irrationally.
- Your character only knows what they've learned through play.

### What Your Character Knows

Your character knows:
- What they've experienced in-game
- Common knowledge about the world (how bodies work, that water matters)
- What other characters have told them

Your character does NOT know:
- Anything from reading documentation
- Anything from previous characters
- Anything from OOC conversations
- Anything that happened after their last clone backup
- Anything from looking at the source code

### Metagaming Is Instant Removal

If you:
- Use out-of-character knowledge in-game
- Coordinate with players outside the game
- Make "optimal" decisions your character couldn't know
- Act on information your clone wouldn't have

You are **gone**. No warnings. No appeals. Permanent ban.

We're not kidding. We will remove you. We have tools to detect this. We use them.

## Who Should Play Malice

You might enjoy Malice if you:

- **Love emergent storytelling.** The best stories are the ones you don't plan.
- **Embrace failure as content.** Losing is interesting. Dying creates drama.
- **Value immersion over winning.** Being your character matters more than succeeding.
- **Want real stakes.** If nothing can be lost, nothing can be won.
- **Enjoy hardcore survival.** Not "challenging" survival. HARDCORE survival.
- **Prefer player-driven worlds.** No NPCs. No scripts. Just people trying to survive.
- **Can separate OOC and IC.** Your best friend in Discord might rob you blind in-game. That's okay.
- **Have time to commit.** This is not a casual game. Your character needs you.

---

## Who Should NOT Play Malice

Please don't play Malice if you:

- **Expect fairness.** Life isn't fair. Malice isn't fair.
- **Can't handle losing.** You will lose. A lot. Often unfairly.
- **Need to win.** There is no winning. There's only survival.
- **Want a power fantasy.** You're not special here. You're prey.
- **Can't separate game from life.** If in-game conflict affects your real friendships, this isn't for you.
- **Need a safety net.** There are none. That's the point.
- **Expect explanations for bad outcomes.** Sometimes you just die. Move on.
- **Can't commit the time.** Your character will die without you. That's not a bug.

---

## The Contract

By playing Malice, you agree to:

1. **Roleplay your character honestly.** Not optimally. Honestly.
2. **Accept permanent consequences.** Death is death. Loss is loss.
3. **Keep IC and OOC separate.** Zero tolerance for metagaming.
4. **Follow one account per person.** No alts. No exceptions.
5. **Accept admin authority.** Admins can do whatever they want. Their judgment is final.
6. **Not be a burden on the community.** Drama queens, rule lawyers, and excuse-makers will be removed.

If you can't agree to all of these, don't play.

## Why This Exists

Most games are afraid to demand anything from their players. They're afraid you'll leave. They water everything down. They add respawns and safe zones and easy modes.

Malice doesn't care if you leave.

We're not trying to maximize player count. We're trying to create an experience that's impossible anywhere else. An experience that only works with total commitment from everyone involved.

The stakes are real because death is permanent.
The roleplay is immersive because it's enforced.
The stories are meaningful because they emerged from genuine struggle.
The cooperation is necessary because solo players die.

You can't have these things without the harsh rules. The rules create the experience.

We expect most people to fail. We expect most people to quit. That's fine. The ones who stay, the ones who adapt, the ones who find their people and build something together in this hostile world - those are the players we want. Those are the stories worth telling.

## One More Thing

**The admins play too.**
