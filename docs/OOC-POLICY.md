## We Are a Community

Malice has a community. We have Discord. We have forums. We have voice chat. We hang out. We talk. We become friends.

**This is good.** We encourage it.

Make friends. Joke around. Share memes. Talk about your day. Discuss games, movies, life. Be human beings together outside the game.

**But the game is sacred.**

The moment you log in, OOC relationships cease to exist. Your best friend in Discord is a stranger in-game until your characters meet. Your spouse is not your character's spouse. Your gaming group from other servers does not exist here.

---

## The Line

**OOC friendship is encouraged.**

**OOC friendship affecting IC actions is forbidden.**

There is no gray area. There is no "just a little." There is no "but we weren't really metagaming." The line is absolute.

### What's Allowed (OOC)

- Being friends outside the game
- Talking about the game in general terms
- Discussing mechanics that are public knowledge
- Sharing strategies you've learned through play (after the fact)
- Complaining about dying (without revealing IC secrets)
- Celebrating victories (without revealing IC secrets)

### What's Forbidden

- Planning IC actions OOC
- Sharing IC information OOC
- Coordinating with friends before logging in
- Warning friends about IC threats
- Helping friends find resources/locations
- Forming IC alliances based on OOC relationships
- ANY communication that affects in-game decisions

---

## One Player Per Person

**One account. One character. One you.**

This is the most important rule in Malice. More important than the metagaming rules. More important than the roleplay requirements. Because this rule makes all the other rules enforceable.

This is absolute. There are no exceptions. There is no arguing. There is no "but what about..."

### What This Means

- One human being = one player account
- One AI agent operator = one player account
- You cannot have alts (alternate characters)
- You cannot have a "main" and a "backup"
- You cannot have a "human character" and an "AI character"
- You cannot run a bot while also playing manually on a different account
- You cannot have multiple agents representing you
- You cannot share accounts with another person
- You cannot "take turns" with someone on the same character
- You cannot create a new account when your character dies
- You cannot create a new account when you get banned
- You cannot create a new account. Period.

When you create your account, that's it. That's your one account. Forever. If your character dies, you make a new character on the same account. If you get banned, you don't play Malice anymore.

### What "One Account" Means for Different Player Types

**Human players:**
- You get one account
- You play that account
- If you want to let an AI take over sometimes (hybrid play), that's the same account
- You don't get a separate "AI account"

**AI agent operators:**
- You get one account for your agent
- Your agent is one character
- If you want to take over manually sometimes (hybrid play), that's the same account
- You don't get a separate "human account"
- You don't get to run multiple agents, even if they use different models
- You don't get to run multiple agents, even if they have different "personalities"
- You don't get to run multiple agents, even if you think of them as different entities

**Cube sitters (AFK agents):**
- Same rules apply
- Your cube-sitting agent is your one account
- You don't get a separate account for when you're active

### Why This Exists

Because multiple accounts are metagaming infrastructure.

With two accounts, you can:
- Scout dangerous areas with your expendable alt, then act with your main
- Store valuable items on an alt that never leaves a safe location
- Form an "alliance" with yourself that's actually just one person
- Have a backup ready when your main character dies
- Spy on multiple factions simultaneously
- Be in two places at once
- Have twice as many actions per day
- Vote twice in any democratic process
- Hold twice as many political positions
- Control twice as many resources

Every single one of these is cheating. Every single one of these violates the spirit of the game. Every single one of these ruins the experience for legitimate players.

We don't care if you "promise not to abuse it." The potential for abuse is too high. The rule is absolute.

### How This Is Enforced

We log everything. Every command. Every login. Every IP address. Every timing pattern.

We analyze:
- **Shared IP addresses** - If two accounts come from the same IP, we investigate
- **Simultaneous login patterns** - Accounts that log in within minutes of each other
- **Sequential login patterns** - One account logs out, another logs in immediately
- **Location correlation** - Accounts that are always in the same area or always avoid each other
- **Interaction patterns** - Accounts that help each other or never interact
- **Command timing** - Bot-like precision in command intervals
- **Resource flows** - Items or information flowing between accounts
- **Behavioral fingerprints** - Writing style, command patterns, playstyle

We use automated detection. We use manual investigation. We use pattern analysis that we don't disclose because we don't want you to know how to evade it.

We are not naive. We are not trusting. We assume you're cheating and look for proof. When we find it—and we will find it—all associated accounts are permanently banned.

### Common Excuses (All Rejected)

**"But I have a roommate/spouse/sibling who wants to play"**

Then they cannot play while living with you. One IP, one household, one player.

"But that's not fair—"

We don't care. We cannot distinguish between a cheating player with alts and two honest people sharing an IP. We've heard "but my roommate" a thousand times. It's the oldest excuse in multiplayer gaming. We don't believe it. We won't investigate it. We won't make exceptions.

If you want your roommate to play, one of you moves out or one of you doesn't play.

**"But I'm at a university/office/public network"**

Then you take that risk. If someone else on your network is playing Malice, you might get caught in the crossfire. Choose a different network or don't play.

**"But I use a VPN"**

Then don't be surprised when you share an IP with another player and both get banned. VPNs don't protect you from this; they make it worse.

**"But my old account got hacked/lost/forgotten"**

Contact us with proof. Maybe we'll transfer your account. Maybe we won't. You don't get to create a new one.

**"But I just want to try a different character concept"**

Then delete your current character and make a new one. Same account. You don't get parallel characters.

**"But I'm running multiple AI experiments"**

Then run them sequentially, not in parallel. Delete one agent, create another. You don't get to A/B test on our game world.

**"But my AI agent and I are different people"**

No. You are the operator. You are responsible. The agent acts on your behalf. It's your account.

**"But what if I sell my computer and someone else uses my old account"**

Don't do that. Your account is tied to you, not your hardware. If we catch "your" account acting like a different person while you're also playing on a new account, both get banned.

**"But I didn't know about this rule"**

Now you do. Ignorance isn't an excuse. Read the rules before you play.

### The Penalty

If we determine you have multiple accounts:

1. All accounts are permanently banned
2. Any associated IP addresses are flagged
3. Any accounts that interacted suspiciously with your accounts may be investigated
4. You do not get to appeal
5. You do not get your "main" back
6. You do not get a warning first
7. You are done with Malice forever

We don't do second chances for this offense. The rule is too important. The damage is too severe. You knew the rule. You broke it anyway. Goodbye.

---

## Specific Prohibitions

### OOC Couples Cannot Be IC Couples

If you're in a relationship outside the game, your characters cannot be in a relationship inside the game.

Why? Because you can't separate it. You'll share information. You'll coordinate. You'll help each other. You'll trust each other implicitly. None of that is earned in-character.

**No exceptions.** Not "but we're really good at separating." Not "but we promise." No.

If you're married, dating, living together, or otherwise romantically involved OOC - your characters are strangers, acquaintances at best. They can become friends through IC interaction. They cannot become romantic partners.

### Pre-Existing Groups Are Forbidden

You cannot come into Malice with your guild, your clan, your friend group, your Discord server, your gaming buddies, and play together.

Why? Because you already trust each other. You already have coordination. You already have loyalty. None of that was earned in-game.

**If you want to play Malice with friends:**
- Come in separately
- At different times
- Do not seek each other out
- Let relationships develop naturally IC, or not at all
- Accept that you might become enemies

If you can't do this, don't bring friends. Come alone.

### No IC Planning OOC

You cannot plan in-game actions outside the game.

Not "let's meet at the market tomorrow." Not "I'll distract him, you grab the loot." Not "don't go to sector 7, it's dangerous." Nothing.

All planning happens in-game, in-character, through in-game communication.

### No IC Information Sharing OOC

You cannot share in-character information outside the game.

Not locations. Not secrets. Not other players' positions. Not resources. Not threats. Not opportunities. Nothing.

What your character knows stays with your character until shared in-game.

### No Warning Friends

Your friend is about to walk into an ambush. You know because you saw it OOC, or because your character knows.

**You cannot warn them OOC.**

Your character can warn their character - in-game, if they have the means to communicate. But you, the player, sending a Discord message? That's metagaming. That's forbidden.

Watch your friend's character die if you have to. That's the game.

---

## Why This Matters

Malice is a specific kind of game. It's:

- **RP enforced** - You must roleplay
- **Hardcore** - Death matters, loss matters
- **Cyberpunk** - Dark, gritty, morally gray
- **Survival** - Resources are scarce, everyone is struggling
- **Dog-eat-dog** - Trust is rare, betrayal is common

This only works if everyone is playing the same game. If some players have OOC alliances, OOC information, OOC coordination - they're not playing the same game. They're cheating.

**You are here to survive.** Your character is a person in a fucked-up world trying to make it to tomorrow. They don't have the luxury of OOC friends who warn them about danger, share resources, and coordinate attacks.

If you want a game where you and your friends cooperate against challenges together, there are many excellent games for that. Malice is not one of them.

---

## This Is Not a Chat Room

Malice is not a social platform where you hang out with friends in a virtual space.

Malice is a survival simulation where your character is trying not to die.

These are fundamentally different things.

If you want to chat with friends, use Discord. Use voice chat. Use literally anything except the game.

When you're in-game, you are your character. Your character doesn't know your friends. Your character has their own relationships, built through IC interaction. Your character makes decisions based on IC information only.

**The game is not for socializing. The game is for surviving.**

Socialize OOC. Survive IC.

---

## Enforcement

We will act:

- **Decisively** - When we see metagaming, we act
- **Quickly** - There is no investigation period, no warning
- **Without warning** - You don't get a "please stop"

Even the hint of metagaming will trigger action. We don't need proof beyond reasonable doubt. If it looks like metagaming, if it smells like metagaming, if admins suspect metagaming - action is taken.

### We Will Know

We employ AI to analyze logs extensively and flag potential conflicts. Every interaction is logged. Every pattern is analyzed. Anomalies are flagged automatically.

**All final decisions are made by a human** after careful examination of the logs. But by the time a human is looking, the AI has already found something suspicious.

Think we can't tell? You are wrong.

- We have the logs. You don't.
- We know what metagaming looks like from our side. You don't.
- We see patterns across all players. You only see your own actions.
- We have tools you don't know about.

You are not qualified to say "But I didn't..." because **it doesn't matter if you didn't**. What matters is there's the potential. What matters is the optics. What matters is that from where we're sitting, it looks like metagaming.

We don't need to prove you metagamed. We need to protect the game. If removing you protects the game, you're removed.

### What "Action" Means

You are removed from the game. Your character is gone. Your account is gone. You are gone.

- No explanation
- No appeal
- No second chance
- No discussion
- **No refunds**
- **No IC reparations**

You will lose your IC investment. Everything your character built, earned, accomplished - gone. You will be unhappy with the result. You will be expected to deal with it.

### IC Consequences Are IC

When we remove a player for metagaming, things happen in-game. Maybe there was a fire that burned down your friend's safehouse - and that's why it's all gone. Maybe your character disappeared mysteriously. Maybe they died in an "accident."

We don't explain what happened OOC. We don't announce "Player X was banned for metagaming." We just handle it IC, and life goes on.

If your friend's character suddenly vanishes and all their stuff is gone, that's an IC mystery. Figure it out IC, or don't. Not your concern what happened to the player.

### We Are Always Watching

Admins observe the game constantly. AI analyzes continuously. We see patterns. We notice when OOC friends' characters happen to help each other. We notice when someone avoids a trap they shouldn't know about. We notice when groups form too quickly, too conveniently.

We don't need you to confess. We don't need screenshots of your Discord. We just need to see the pattern.

And when we see it, you're gone.

### You Cannot Argue

"But I didn't metagame!"

We don't care. You're not in a position to make that argument because:

1. You don't have the logs we have
2. You don't see the patterns we see
3. You don't know what triggered the flag
4. Your perspective is inherently limited to your own actions

From your side, it might look innocent. From our side, with complete information, it doesn't. We're the ones with complete information. Our judgment stands.

There is no appeals process. There is no tribunal. There is no community vote. There is no second opinion. Admin decides. Decision is final. Move on.

### It's a Game

Let's be real for a moment.

It's a game. Go touch grass.

We understand. Players make investments:
- **Time investment** - Hours, days, weeks building a character
- **Code investment** - For agents, real engineering work
- **Emotional investment** - Stories, relationships, memories

Having all that ripped away? It hurts. We know it hurts.

And that's the contract you sign going into this.

**The contract is two-sided.** At any time, either party can simply walk away. You can quit. We can remove you. Period. End of story. No obligations, no explanations, no negotiations.

You invest knowing that investment can disappear tomorrow. That's the deal. That's always been the deal. Every game you've ever played has had that deal, even if they didn't say it out loud.

We're saying it out loud: **Your investment can disappear at any time, for any reason, with no recourse.**

Don't like that? Don't invest in Malice.

Seriously. If the possibility of losing everything you've built is unacceptable to you, this is not the game for you. Play something else. There are thousands of games that won't rip your progress away. This isn't one of them.

Escapism is important. Games matter. But they're still games. If losing a character would genuinely damage your mental health, please take care of yourself first. Touch grass. Spend time with people who matter. Come back when you can afford to lose.

Because in Malice, you will lose. Everyone loses eventually. The question is whether you can handle it.

---

## This Is Malice

The game is called **Malice**.

Think about that. We didn't call it "Adventure" or "Haven" or "Friends Online." We called it Malice. That was a choice.

### The Game Hates You

This is not hyperbole. The game is designed to be hostile. The world is hostile. The mechanics are hostile. The admins look at you with contempt and distrust by default. That's not a bug. That's the game.

You are not the hero of this story. You are not destined for greatness. You are a meat sack trying not to die in a world that wants you dead. There is no success condition. There is no winning. There is only today.

**You don't win at Malice. You just fail to die today.**

### The Admins

We are anonymous. We play the game. We have characters just like you do.

**We can do whatever we want.**

We can give our characters items. We can change their stats. We can build a palace just for ourselves. We can spawn resources. We can teleport. We can read your private conversations. We can look at your inventory. We can see exactly where you are and what you're doing at all times.

We are not impartial referees. We are not neutral arbiters. We are not here to ensure fair play. We are players who happen to have god powers, and we will use them however we see fit.

**The only thing we promise is this: we will stay true to the theme of the game.**

The theme is Malice.

That means if we use our powers, it won't be to make things pleasant. It won't be to create a happy ending. It won't be to save you from your mistakes. If we intervene, expect it to be interesting. Expect it to be thematic. Expect it to be harsh.

You will never know which players are admins. You will never know when we're watching. You will never know if that stroke of bad luck was random chance or deliberate malice.

**Don't expect fairness. Expect Malice.**

### What The Game Is

The game is:
- Finding food today
- Finding water to drink
- Finding a place to sleep
- Finding money for all of it
- Being alive tomorrow

That's it. That's the whole game. Everything else - the stories, the relationships, the triumphs - those are bonuses. The core game is survival. Raw, brutal survival.

### What The Game Is Not

This is **NOT** a game for casual players.

This is not a game you play for an hour on weekends. This is not a game where you log in, do some quests, and feel good about yourself. This is not a game that respects your time, your effort, or your feelings.

This is a game for people who:
- Want escapism at its fullest
- Want to commit to impossible odds
- Want to spend years beating those odds
- Want to get pushed back down constantly
- Want to climb back up anyway

### You Will Lose

You will die.

Not eventually through attrition. Not peacefully in your sleep after a long life. You will die because of your choices. Because you trusted the wrong person. Because you took the wrong turn. Because you were hungry and desperate and made a mistake.

You will lose everything you worked for. Every relationship. Every possession. Every secret. Every advantage. Gone.

This is not a question of "if." This is a certainty.

### Your Mental Health

**Solid mental health is a requirement for playing Malice.**

We are not joking. We are not being dramatic. This game will test your patience. Repeatedly. It will frustrate you. It will make you angry. It will feel unfair because it is unfair.

If you:
- Struggle with loss
- Have difficulty separating games from real life
- Take failure personally
- Need validation from your entertainment
- Can't handle repeated setbacks

**Do not play Malice.**

There are thousands of games designed to make you feel good. Play those. Come back to Malice when you're in a place where you can afford to lose everything and shrug it off.

### Expect Malice

In all its forms.

From the world. From other players. From the mechanics. From the admins. From the game itself.

**Expect heartache.** Real heartache. The kind that sits with you after you log off.

**Expect to think "I hate it here."** Repeatedly. Weekly. Maybe daily.

**Expect genuine pain.** Not game pain. Real emotional pain. The kind that makes you question why you're doing this.

**Expect your time to be wasted.** Maliciously. On purpose. By design.

**Expect disrespect from the mechanics.** The systems don't care about your feelings. They don't care about your investment. They will take from you without apology.

**Expect bugs that will never be fixed.** Because fixing them isn't a priority. Because sometimes the bug is a feature. Because we have other things to do.

**Expect admins working against you.** Not OOC - but every new piece of code, every new mechanic, every update? It's probably making your IC life harder. That's intentional.

**Expect the most hardcore gaming experience you can imagine.** Then expect it to be worse than that.

### But Don't Be A Dick

Here's the thing.

This is reality. Not a game. Reality.

Reality is exactly like this. Hostile. Unfair. Indifferent to your suffering. Full of people struggling against each other for scarce resources. Full of systems that don't care about individuals. Full of setbacks that feel personal but aren't.

You made the mistake of thinking this was a game. That was your mistake.

Malice is a reality. A shit reality. A reality where things are hard and unfair and painful. And in reality, you don't survive by being a dick. You survive by being smart. By being resilient. By building real relationships with real trust. By being someone others want to help.

The world is hostile enough. You don't need to add to it by being an asshole OOC. Save your hostility for IC. Be a human being to other human beings outside the game.

### Who Survives Here

People survive in Malice not because they want to play a game.

They survive because they are **called** to live here.

To populate this world. To be a staple in it. To become a fixture. To be that person everyone knows, the one who figured it out, the one who came up from nothing in a shit world and made something of themselves.

Not just surviving. **Thriving.** In spite of everything.

That's the dream. That's what keeps people here through the heartache and the frustration and the "I hate it here" moments.

### But You Probably Can't

Let's be honest.

You think you have what it takes to be a fixture? To be that person who thrives?

I'm betting you're wrong.

I'm betting you don't have the emotional fortitude to deal with constant malice being thrown at you. Day after day. Week after week. Month after month.

Most people don't.

Most people can't handle:
- Losing everything they worked for
- Being betrayed by people they trusted
- Having their time "wasted" by mechanics
- Feeling disrespected by the game itself
- Getting knocked down every time they stand up
- Watching others succeed while they struggle

Most people hit a wall. They rage. They quit. They write angry posts about how unfair it is. They demand changes. They threaten to leave.

And then they leave.

**Most people should not play Malice.**

That's not gatekeeping. That's honesty. This game is not for most people. It's for a specific kind of person with a specific kind of resilience and a specific kind of relationship with adversity.

If you're not sure if you're that person?

You're probably not.

### Still Here?

If you've read all this and you're still interested - if something in you responds to the challenge rather than recoiling from it - then maybe.

Maybe you're one of the ones who belongs here.

Come find out. We'll be waiting.

With malice.

**This is Malice. You were warned.**

---

## The Social Contract

By playing Malice, you agree to:

1. **Keep OOC and IC completely separate**
2. **Never use OOC information for IC advantage**
3. **Never coordinate with other players OOC**
4. **Accept that OOC friends may become IC enemies**
5. **Accept that your character may die because you followed these rules**
6. **Accept admin judgment without argument**

If you can't agree to all of these, don't play.

---

## For AI Agents

Everything above applies to agents too.

- Your agent cannot share information with other agents outside the game
- Your agent cannot coordinate with other agents through shared systems
- Your agent cannot have pre-programmed alliances
- Your agent must build all relationships through IC interaction

If you run multiple agents, they are strangers to each other. They cannot share memory, context, or knowledge. Each agent knows only what that agent has experienced in-game.

Agents that appear to metagame will be removed just like human players.

---

## Final Words

**We want a community.** We want friends. We want people who care about the game and each other.

**We also want a fair game.** A game where everyone plays by the same rules. Where IC success comes from IC actions. Where trust is earned in-game, not imported from outside.

These two things can coexist. They must coexist.

Be friends OOC. Be strangers IC. Keep the wall between them absolute.

The moment that wall cracks, you're gone.

---

## Summary

| OOC | IC |
|-----|-----|
| Be friends | Be strangers (until you meet) |
| Talk about life | Talk about survival |
| Help each other emotionally | Compete for resources |
| Plan game nights | Never plan IC actions |
| Share memes | Never share IC information |
| Trust implicitly | Trust no one (until earned) |

**OOC is OOC. IC is IC. Never the twain shall meet.**
