  description: `A fishing pier extends into Elliott Bay here, one of the last public fishing spots on the urban waterfront. The railings are still lined with rod holders, some still holding rods abandoned mid-cast. The fish didn't stop biting when humanity stopped fishing. They're probably thriving.

The bay stretches west to the horizon, grey water meeting grey sky. The seawall drops fifteen feet to the surface—no way down without a rope, no way across without a boat. Elliott Bay is Pioneer Square's western boundary, as impassable as any wall.

Crab pots are stacked against the seawall, wire mesh rusted, buoys faded. The crabs are still down there, doing whatever crabs do. Waiting. Scavenging.

The port cranes stand silent to the south, monuments to commerce that no longer moves. The waterfront continues north and south. The bay continues west, grey and endless, offering nothing to those who cannot sail.`,
