  description: `The port district begins in earnest here. The tourist waterfront is behind you; this is where the real work happened. Container yards stretch inland, stacked boxes in faded colors—Maersk blue, Evergreen green, Hanjin orange—a Tetris game frozen mid-play.

The containers closest to the water have been broken into, their locks cut, their contents scattered or stolen. Televisions and furniture and clothing, all worthless now, all looted anyway because looting is what you do when the rules stop.

A security fence runs along the perimeter, its razor wire still sharp, its gates hanging open. The guards left when the paychecks stopped. The fence remains, a boundary that no longer means anything.

The cranes loom ahead, their arms stretched over the water, waiting for ships that have stopped coming.`,
