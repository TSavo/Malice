  description: `A grain elevator rises from the waterfront here, a concrete monolith stained with decades of weather and neglect. The conveyor belts that once carried wheat from rail cars to ship holds hang slack, their rubber cracked and peeling. The grain is gone. The ships that carried it are gone. The farmers who grew it are probably gone too.

Pigeons have colonized the upper levels, their cooing a constant murmur from above. Their droppings coat the sidewalk in grey-white streaks. They don't care about the end of the world. They never cared about anything.

A security booth sits at the base of the elevator, its windows intact, its door locked. Inside, monitors display static. The cameras they connected to are probably still working, recording nothing to drives that will eventually fill and stop.

The industrial waterfront stretches south toward the port.`,
