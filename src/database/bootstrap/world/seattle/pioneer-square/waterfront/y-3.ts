  description: `The railroad tracks here are partially buried under debris that washed up during the storm surge. Driftwood and plastic bottles and the bloated remains of things that floated. No one cleaned it up. No one was left to care.

A maintenance shed sits beside the tracks, its corrugated walls dented, its padlock hanging open and useless. Tools are scattered inside, rusted but potentially useful. Someone took the best ones already. They left behind a workbench and a calendar from two years ago, still turned to March.

The waterfront curves slightly here, following the natural contour of the bay. The view of the city from this angle is almost beautiful, if you squint and forget what happened. The buildings still stand. The skyline still has its shape. From here, you could almost believe nothing changed.

You would be wrong.`,
