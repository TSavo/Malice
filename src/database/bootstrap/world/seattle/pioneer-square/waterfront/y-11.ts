  description: `The waterfront narrows here as the port facilities crowd against the seawall. Chain-link fences topped with razor wire create a corridor between the container yards and the water. The fences are intact but the gates swing open in the wind.

To the west, Elliott Bay laps against the seawall—cold grey water stretching to the horizon, impassable without a boat. The seawall is fifteen feet of sheer concrete. The bay is Pioneer Square's western edge, as absolute a boundary as the mountains.

A customs inspection station sits at the corner, its booth empty, barrier arm raised and stuck. Shipping manifests flutter in the breeze—bills of lading for goods from Shanghai and Busan. The global supply chain, reduced to litter.

S. King Street intersection lies just ahead to the south. The waterfront continues north. The bay stretches west toward shores that might as well be another world—Bainbridge, Bremerton, places that exist only in memory now.`,
