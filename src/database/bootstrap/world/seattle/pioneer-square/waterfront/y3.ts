  description: `A fire station sits at the edge of the waterfront, its doors closed, its engines silent inside. Fireboat 1 was moored at the pier beside it, but the pier collapsed months ago and took the boat with it. The hull is still visible at low tide, resting on the bottom in fifteen feet of water.

The station itself is intact, its brick facade blackened by smoke from some fire that came and went. The windows are boarded. Someone spray-painted "STILL HERE" on the boards. The paint is fading.

Emergency lights still flash on the roof, powered by solar panels that don't know the emergency is over. Red and white, red and white, a beacon for rescuers who aren't coming.

Beyond the seawall, Elliott Bay stretches toward Bainbridge Island and the Kitsap Peninsula beyond. The water is grey today, as it usually is—Puget Sound reflecting Puget Sound weather. The bay has always been Seattle's western boundary, as impassable as it is beautiful. The only way forward is back into the city.`,
