  description: `The waterfront runs along Elliott Bay's edge, the seawall holding back the Puget Sound as it has since the 1930s. The seawall was built during the Depression, a WPA project that employed thousands and lasted nearly a century. Its concrete is cracked now, water seeping through in places, but the wall still holds. Mostly.

The sinkhole is visible to the east, a flooded depression where the ground collapsed and never stopped sinking. The water in the hole is dark and still, connected to the bay through cracks in the seawall that no one ever repaired. The smell of salt water and decay mixes here, ocean and ruin becoming indistinguishable.

Gulls circle overhead, the only consistent life along this stretch. They've adapted to the post-human waterfront, finding food in the bay as they did before the city existed. The gulls will outlast everything built here.`,
