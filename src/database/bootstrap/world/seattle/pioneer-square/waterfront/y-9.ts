  description: `The waterfront narrows here as the port facilities crowd against the seawall. Chain-link fences topped with razor wire line both sides of the road, creating a corridor between the container yards and the water. The fences are intact but the gates are open, swinging in the wind.

A customs inspection station sits at the corner, its booth empty, its barrier arm raised and stuck. The x-ray machine inside is dark. The drug dogs are gone. The contraband that passed through here in the early days is long since dispersed into the city.

Shipping manifests flutter in the breeze, escaped from some office and scattered across the concrete. Bills of lading for goods from Shanghai and Busan and Ho Chi Minh City. The global supply chain, reduced to litter.

S. King Street is visible to the south, marking the edge of Pioneer Square.`,
