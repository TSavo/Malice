// Waterfront - between S. Washington St and Yesler Way

  name: 'Alaskan Way',
  description: `The waterfront runs along Elliott Bay here, the seawall separating the road from fifteen feet of open air and then cold, grey water. The bay stretches west toward Bainbridge Island and the Olympic Mountains beyond—visible on clear days, a smudge of memory on overcast ones.

There's no way west. The seawall is sheer, the water deep, the current treacherous. Without a boat, the bay is an absolute boundary.

Empty storefronts line the eastern side, their windows dark, their tourist-trap merchandise still visible through the grime. T-shirts and coffee mugs and Space Needle keychains, the detritus of a tourism industry that died with everything else.

The waterfront continues north toward Yesler and south toward Washington. The bay continues west, indifferent to those who stand at its edge without means to cross.`,
