  description: `The waterfront approaches the old pier district here, where tourist attractions once clustered along the bay. The Great Wheel's skeleton is visible to the north, the massive Ferris wheel that dominated the skyline until it collapsed during a winter storm sometime in the long dark years. Its gondolas lie scattered in the water, slowly rusting into artificial reefs.

Pier buildings line the waterfront to the east, their facades showing the deliberate rusticity that tourist districts cultivate—weathered wood that was never actually weathered, nautical themes applied by designers who'd never been to sea. The deliberate charm has become genuine decay, artificial rusticity giving way to actual rot.

The seawall path is wider here, designed for the foot traffic of the tourist trade. The extra width feels extravagant now, empty space that once held crowds, cotton candy vendors, street performers, the whole apparatus of leisure. The apparatus rusted along with everything else.`,
