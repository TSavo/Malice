  description: `The waterfront approaches the old pier district here. The Great Wheel's skeleton is visible to the north, the massive Ferris wheel that dominated the skyline until it collapsed. Its gondolas lie scattered in the water below, slowly rusting into artificial reefs.

To the west, Elliott Bay stretches toward the Olympics, grey and cold and impassable. The seawall drops fifteen feet to water that's deeper than it looks. Without a boat, the bay is an absolute barrier—Pioneer Square's western edge.

Pier buildings line the eastern side, their facades showing the deliberate rusticity that tourist districts cultivate—weathered wood that was never actually weathered. The deliberate charm has become genuine decay, artificial rusticity giving way to actual rot.

The waterfront continues north and south along the seawall. The bay continues west to shores you cannot reach—not without a boat, and the boats are gone.`,
