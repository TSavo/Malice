  description: `The seawall path continues along the bay, the concrete walkway that once carried tourists and joggers and lunchtime wanderers. The path is cracked but passable, weeds growing through the gaps where maintenance crews no longer venture. The view of the bay is unobstructed—grey water meeting grey sky at a horizon that looks closer than it should.

Rusted bollards line the water's edge, their chains long since stolen or corroded away. The bollards were decorative as much as functional, meant to evoke maritime heritage rather than actually secure anything. The heritage they evoked is more genuine now, in the decay, than it ever was in the design.

A collapsed pier extends into the water to the west, its wooden planks rotted through, its pilings listing at angles that speak to decades of tidal assault. The pier was probably historic once, probably had a plaque. The plaque is underwater now, with whatever history it commemorated.`,
