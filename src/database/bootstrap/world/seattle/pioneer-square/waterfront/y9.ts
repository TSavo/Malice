  description: `The waterfront curves toward the gap in the seawall that provides passage to downtown—the only crossing point that remained open after the burning blocked all other routes. The gap is visible ahead, a crack in the concrete barrier where the wall collapsed and was never repaired. The collapse was accidental, a structural failure rather than deliberate destruction, but it became the most important geography in the district.

The pier buildings thin out here, the tourist district giving way to working waterfront that predates the gentrification. Old warehouse structures line the eastern edge, their brick and timber construction dating to the early twentieth century when cargo moved by hand and dock workers were plentiful. The warehouses are empty now, their contents long since scavenged, but the structures themselves remain sound.

The sound of water against the seawall is louder here, waves channeled by the gap ahead into patterns that slap and surge. The acoustic change marks the approach to the crossing, the only way through to whatever lies beyond.`,
