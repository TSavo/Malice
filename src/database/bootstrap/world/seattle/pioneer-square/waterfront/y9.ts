  description: `The waterfront curves toward the gap in the seawall that provides passage to downtown—the only crossing point that remained open after the burning blocked all other routes. The gap is visible ahead, a crack in the concrete where the wall collapsed and was never repaired.

To the west, Elliott Bay is an impassable barrier. The seawall drops fifteen feet to cold grey water, deep and treacherous. Without a boat, the bay cannot be crossed. The currents alone would kill you before the cold finished the job.

The pier buildings thin out here, the tourist district giving way to working waterfront. Old warehouse structures line the eastern edge, their brick and timber construction dating to the early twentieth century. The warehouses are empty now but structurally sound.

North leads toward the gap—the only way to downtown. South continues along the waterfront. The bay stretches west, cold and grey and absolute, the same boundary it has always been.`,
