  description: `A container ship is moored at the pier here, the MV Pacific Trader, her hull streaked with rust, her deck stacked with containers that will never reach their destinations. She was mid-loading when everything stopped. Half her cargo is still on the dock, half is aboard. She'll sit here until she rusts through or someone decides to move her.

The ship's gangway is still extended, swaying slightly in the wind. The crew quarters are dark. Whatever happened to the crew, they're not aboard anymore. Probably.

Seabirds have claimed the deck, their guano coating the containers in white streaks. They've built nests in the cranes and the rigging. The ship is theirs now.

The waterfront continues, grey concrete and grey water and grey sky all merging at the edges.`,
