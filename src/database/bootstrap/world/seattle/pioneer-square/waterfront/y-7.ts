  description: `The waterfront curves slightly here, following the natural contour of Elliott Bay where it meets the mouth of the Duwamish River. The river is invisible from this angle, hidden by the industrial port facilities to the south, but its influence is present in the sediment patterns visible at low tide—darker mud where river water meets salt water.

The buildings that once lined this stretch are gone, cleared for waterfront development projects that never materialized. Concrete foundations mark where structures stood, gridlines of what might have been. The empty lots have returned to scrub grass and blackberry brambles, the city's edge rewilding itself one season at a time.

The smell of the bay is strong here—salt and seaweed and something organic decomposing slowly in the tidal zone. It's not unpleasant, exactly. It's the smell of edges, of transitions, of places where one thing becomes another.`,
