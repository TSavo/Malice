  description: `A parking lot occupies the block between the waterfront and Pioneer Square proper. It's empty now except for a few abandoned vehicles, their tires flat, their windows fogged with condensation or grime. A pay station stands in the center, still displaying rates by the hour. Time has become meaningless, but the machine doesn't know that.

The asphalt is cracked, weeds pushing through. Blackberry brambles have claimed the eastern edge, their thorns a natural barrier between the lot and the buildings beyond.

A seagull stands on a rusted shopping cart, watching. It has learned that humans sometimes mean food. It hasn't unlearned this yet.

The water is close here, the sound of it lapping against the seawall a constant rhythm beneath the silence.`,
