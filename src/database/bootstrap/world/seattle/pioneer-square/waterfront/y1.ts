  description: `The ferry terminal rises ahead, its green-roofed tower a landmark visible from across the bay. Colman Dock, they called it. The ferries to Bainbridge and Bremerton left from here every hour, carrying commuters and tourists and people who just wanted to be somewhere else for a while.

The ferries stopped running when the fuel ran out. The terminal remains, its waiting rooms empty, its ticket windows dark. The schedule boards still display departure times. 6:10 to Bainbridge. 6:20 to Bremerton. The times mean nothing now.

A homeless encampment once occupied this stretch of sidewalk. The tents are gone but their outlines remain, rectangles of cleaner concrete where the fabric blocked the grime. The people moved on or moved inside or stopped moving entirely.

The terminal waits, patient and purposeless.`,
