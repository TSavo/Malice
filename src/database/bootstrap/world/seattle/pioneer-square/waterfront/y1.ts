  description: `The ferry terminal rises ahead, its green-roofed tower a landmark visible from across the bay. Colman Dock, they called it. The ferries to Bainbridge and Bremerton left from here every hour. The ferries stopped when the fuel ran out. The terminal remains, waiting rooms empty, ticket windows dark.

To the west, Elliott Bay stretches toward the Olympic Mountains, grey water meeting grey sky. The seawall drops fifteen feet to the water—no way down, no way across without a boat. The bay is Pioneer Square's western boundary, absolute and impassable.

A homeless encampment once occupied this stretch of sidewalk. The tents are gone but their outlines remain, rectangles of cleaner concrete where the fabric blocked the grime.

The waterfront continues north and south. The bay continues forever, or at least to the far shore where the Olympics rise—but without a boat, you might as well be looking at the moon.`,
