  description: `The largest of the port cranes stands here, a red-painted giant that could lift forty-ton containers like a child lifting blocks. Its operator cab is fifty meters up, accessible by a ladder that nobody has climbed in months. The controls are probably still functional. The diesel that powered it is probably still in the tanks.

A crane this size was worth millions. Now it's worth whatever someone will trade for scrap steel. Which is nothing, because there's no one left to smelt it.

The operator's lunch box is still in the cab. You can see it through the window if you look up at the right angle. A blue cooler, faded by sun. Whatever was inside has long since rotted away.

The port stretches south. The city huddles to the east. The bay waits to the west, patient and cold.`,
