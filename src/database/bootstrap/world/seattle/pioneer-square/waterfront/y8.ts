  description: `The waterfront here is lined with the shells of tourist shops. T-shirts and shot glasses and miniature Space Needles, all left behind when the tourists stopped coming. The windows are mostly intact, the merchandise still visible inside, gathering dust and meaning nothing.

A crab pot sits overturned on the sidewalk, rusted through. Someone used it as a fire pit once. The ashes are old and cold and scattered by wind.

The seawall drops fifteen feet to the water. The tide is out, exposing mud and rocks and things that should stay submerged. The smell is low tide and diesel and something organic that you don't want to identify.

To the east, the brick facades of Pioneer Square rise in ordered rows. To the west, Elliott Bay stretches toward islands that are just shapes in the haze.`,
