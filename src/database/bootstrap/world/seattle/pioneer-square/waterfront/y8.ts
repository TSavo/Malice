  description: `An old steamship is moored here, or what's left of one. The Virginia V, a historic vessel that once carried passengers across Puget Sound. She's listing now, taking on water, her white paint gone grey and her brass fixtures green with verdigris. Someone tried to live aboard her for a while. The makeshift curtains in the portholes are the only color left.

The pier she's tied to groans with each swell. The ropes are fraying. Eventually she'll sink or drift away or both. No one is coming to save her.

A ticket booth stands on the waterfront, its window smashed, its cash drawer hanging open and empty. The schedule posted inside lists departures that will never happen to destinations that don't matter anymore.

The city rises to the east, offering the only passage forward. The water waits to the west, patient and impassable, the same grey expanse that has bounded Seattle since before there was a Seattle.`,
