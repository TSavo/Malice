  description: `A fishing pier extends into the bay here, one of the last public fishing spots on the urban waterfront. The railings are still lined with rod holders, some still holding rods that were abandoned mid-cast. The fish didn't stop biting when humanity stopped fishing. They're probably thriving.

A bait shop occupies a converted shipping container at the pier's base. The container is still sealed, its contents unknown. The smell suggests the bait inside has long since passed its useful state.

Crab pots are stacked against the seawall, their wire mesh rusted, their buoys faded. Someone could still use them, probably. The crabs are still down there, doing whatever crabs do. Waiting. Scavenging. Carrying on.

The port cranes are visible to the south, silent sentinels over a harbor that no longer moves.`,
