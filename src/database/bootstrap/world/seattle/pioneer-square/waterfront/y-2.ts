  description: `South of the ferry terminal, the waterfront takes on an industrial character. The tourist attractions give way to working piers, or what used to be working piers. Forklifts sit abandoned, their forks raised, their batteries dead. Pallets are stacked in rows, wrapped in plastic that has turned brittle and torn.

A warehouse dominates the block to the east, its loading doors sealed with corrugated steel. Whatever is inside, someone wanted it to stay inside. The locks are heavy. The welds are recent.

The seawall here is stained with rust bleeding down from the railroad tracks above. The trains stopped running months ago, but the tracks remain, parallel lines of oxidizing steel leading north and south to nowhere.

Oil rainbows swirl on puddles between the cobblestones. Beyond the seawall, Elliott Bay stretches west—grey water meeting grey sky, offering nothing to those without boats. The bay has always been Seattle's western edge. It always will be.`,
