  description: `The waterfront stretches along the edge of Elliott Bay, a narrow strip of concrete and decay between the water and the city. The seawall here is holding, mostly. Cracks spider across its surface but the fill behind it hasn't slumped yet. Small victories.

A derelict pier juts into the bay, its planks rotted through in places, its pilings wrapped in barnacles and rust. A sign advertises harbor tours. The tour boats are gone, sunk or stolen or simply drifted away.

The elevated highway that once shadowed this stretch was torn down years ago. The city called it progress. Now the open sky just means there's nothing between you and the grey clouds rolling in off the Sound.

Smith Tower is visible to the east, rising above the brick buildings of Pioneer Square. It watches. It has always watched. To the west, Elliott Bay offers nothing but grey water and the distant promise of shores you cannot reach—not without a boat, and the boats are gone or sunk or someone else's problem now.`,
