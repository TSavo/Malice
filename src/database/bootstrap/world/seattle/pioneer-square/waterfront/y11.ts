// Waterfront - approaching Yesler Way from south

  description: `The waterfront approaches Yesler Way here, where the gap in the seawall provides the only passage to downtown. To the west, Elliott Bay laps against the concrete barrier—cold grey water stretching to the horizon, impassable without a boat.

The seawall is fifteen feet high along this stretch, a sheer drop to water that's deeper than it looks. The currents are deceptive, the water cold enough to kill. The bay has always been Pioneer Square's western boundary, and it always will be.

Old warehouse structures line the eastern side, brick and timber construction from when cargo moved by hand. The warehouses are empty now but structurally sound.

Yesler Way intersection lies just ahead to the north—the crossing point to downtown. South leads back along the waterfront. The bay waits to the west, patient as water always is, offering passage only to those with boats that no longer exist.`,
