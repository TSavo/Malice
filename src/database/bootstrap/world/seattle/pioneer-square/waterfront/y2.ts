  description: `The Great Wheel looms to the north, Seattle's waterfront Ferris wheel, still standing but no longer turning. Its gondolas hang motionless, swaying slightly in the wind off the bay. At night, if you look up at the right angle, you can sometimes see figures in the gondolas. Probably just shadows. Probably.

A souvenir stand sits beneath the wheel's shadow, its windows smashed, its shelves picked clean. The cash register is gone entirely, pried from its mount. The thieves left behind a rack of postcards showing Seattle as it was. Blue sky. Clean streets. People smiling.

The waterfront promenade is wide here, meant for crowds that no longer come. The concrete is stained with salt and oil and things that washed up and were never cleaned away.

The seawall drops away to Elliott Bay, fifteen feet of air and then cold grey water that stretches to the horizon. The ferries that once crossed to Bainbridge are gone. The water remains, eternal and indifferent, accepting nothing that cannot float.`,
