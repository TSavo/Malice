  description: `The street widens here where Fourth Avenue approaches its intersection with the old viaduct alignment. The extra width was meant for merging traffic, vehicles transitioning from surface streets to elevated highway. The highway is gone. The width remains, feeling excessive for the nothing that uses it now.

Chinatown's influence is stronger here, the architecture showing more of the International District's character—lower buildings, ground-floor retail, residential above. The bilingual signage has weathered at different rates, English fading faster than the Chinese characters that seem more resistant to sun and rain.

A fire hydrant stands at the corner, its red paint faded to pink, its cap rusted shut. The water mains might still hold pressure, or might have burst somewhere underground years ago. No one has tested them. No one wants to know.`,
