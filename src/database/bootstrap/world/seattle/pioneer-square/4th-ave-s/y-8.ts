  description: `The Condemned Block extends along the western side of the avenue here, its perimeter fence reinforced with concrete barriers. Whatever containment was attempted, it was done in a hurry. The barriers are misaligned, the fencing hastily welded. It holds, mostly.

An auto repair shop operates on the eastern side, one of the few businesses still functioning in any sense. Cars in various states of disassembly fill the lot. Parts are currency now, and this place has parts. The owner—if there is still an owner—has done well.

Graffiti covers the concrete barriers around the Condemned Block. Tags and murals and warnings. "DON'T BREATHE" someone wrote in letters three feet tall. Good advice, probably.

A shopping cart sits in the middle of the avenue, filled with blankets and cans and the accumulated necessities of someone who lived rough. The cart's owner is not visible. The cart remains.`,
