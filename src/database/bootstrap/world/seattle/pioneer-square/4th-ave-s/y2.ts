  description: `A traditional Chinese medicine shop occupies the corner, its window display unchanged since before the Event. Dried herbs in glass jars. Ginseng roots in velvet boxes. Acupuncture charts showing meridian lines on faded anatomical drawings. The medicine inside might still work. No one has tested it.

Across the avenue, a construction site sits abandoned, its tower crane frozen mid-swing. The building was going to be condos, affordable housing mandated by the city, units for people who were priced out of everywhere else. The people found other places to go. The condos will never be finished.

Orange construction fencing has blown down in sections, revealing the pit where the foundation was being dug. Rainwater has filled the excavation, creating an urban pond where ducks have taken up residence. They seem content.

The cranes arm points accusingly at the sky, holding nothing.`,
