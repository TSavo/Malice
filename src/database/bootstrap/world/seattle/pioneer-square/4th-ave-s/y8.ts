  description: `The edge of the Collapsed Building is visible to the west, a mountain of debris that used to be an office tower. From this angle you can see into the exposed floors, the desks and chairs and filing cabinets all tumbled together like a child's dollhouse kicked over in anger.

A dim sum restaurant sits across the avenue, its bamboo steamers still stacked in the window. The dumplings inside became biology experiments long ago. The steamers remain, towers of woven bamboo waiting for a kitchen that will never reopen.

A bus shelter stands at the curb, its schedule still posted behind scratched plexiglass. Route 7, running every fifteen minutes to Rainier Beach. The route hasn't run in months. The schedule hasn't been updated. Someone scratched "LIES" into the plexiglass over the times.

The light rail tracks overhead are silent, their catenary wires slack and swaying.`,
