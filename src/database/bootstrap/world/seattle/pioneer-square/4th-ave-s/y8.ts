  description: `A parking garage rises on the Pioneer Square side of the avenue, its concrete ramps spiraling upward into darkness. Cars are still parked inside, visible through the open walls of the structure. Their owners never came back for them. The daily rate continues to accumulate on tickets that no one will ever pay.

Across the avenue, a Vietnamese restaurant occupies the corner, its pho sign still lit by solar panels on the roof. The broth pots are cold. The herbs in the window boxes have gone to seed. Someone left a tip on the counter, coins scattered next to an empty bowl.

The elevated light rail tracks cast shadows across the street, geometric patterns that shift with the sun. The trains don't run. The shadows still move.

Pigeons roost in the parking structure, their cooing echoing down the concrete ramps.`,
