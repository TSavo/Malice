  description: `The fallen Chinatown gate lies just to the north, its dragons staring up at the sky with cracked ceramic eyes. The red columns that once held it upright now lean against the buildings on either side, creating a kind of accidental arch. Some people climb over. Most go around.

Fourth Avenue stretches south, the boundary between Pioneer Square and the International District. The boundary was always artificial, a line on a map that tried to separate neighborhoods that had long since blended together. Now both sides share the same silence.

A bubble tea shop occupies the ground floor of the building to the east, its cartoon mascot still grinning in the window. The tea has long since spoiled. The tapioca pearls have become something else entirely. The mascot keeps smiling.

Red paper lanterns hang from the fire escapes above, their silk rotted to ribbons, their wire frames exposed like bones.`,
