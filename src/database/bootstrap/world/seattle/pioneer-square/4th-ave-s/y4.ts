  description: `A light rail station entrance descends into the sidewalk here, its escalators frozen mid-step. The station below connects to the International District, a underground hub where multiple lines once converged. The lines are silent now. The hub is dark.

Someone has set up a shrine at the station entrance. Candles in red glass holders, burned down to nothing. Photographs in plastic sleeves, faces smiling at cameras that no longer exist. Incense sticks in a sand-filled bowl, their ash long since scattered by wind.

A jewelry store occupies the corner, its window display still arranged with jade pendants and gold chains. The security gate is down but the glass behind it is intact. The jewels remain, valuable and useless, waiting for customers with currency that no longer matters.

The avenue stretches north and south, empty and wide.`,
