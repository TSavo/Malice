  description: `The Collapsed Building looms to the west, its debris field extending almost to the avenue. A chain-link fence was erected to keep people out, but sections have been cut or pushed aside. People go in anyway. Looking for salvage. Looking for the dead. Looking for whatever people look for in ruins.

A Chinese bakery occupies the eastern corner, its display cases still arranged with plastic replicas of the cakes it once sold. The real cakes rotted months ago. The plastic ones remain, eternal and inedible, promising sweetness that cannot be delivered.

Graffiti covers the fence around the debris field. Messages in multiple languages. Names of the missing. Prayers. Curses. Someone spray-painted a mural of a phoenix rising from flames. The phoenix is faded now, its colors bleached by sun and rain.

The avenue continues, indifferent to the ruin beside it.`,
