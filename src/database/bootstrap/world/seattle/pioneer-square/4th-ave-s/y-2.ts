  description: `A martial arts studio occupies the second floor of a building here, its windows still displaying faded posters of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. The training dummies inside are visible through the glass, wooden arms extended, waiting for students who will never return to practice their forms.

Below the studio, a noodle shop advertises hand-pulled noodles in both Chinese and English. The flour is probably still good. The technique died with the person who knew it. Some things cannot be preserved in jars or freezers.

A fire hydrant on the corner has been painted gold, a tradition in the district meant to bring prosperity. The gold paint is chipping, revealing layers beneath—red, then silver, then the original iron. Decades of hope, layered and peeling.

The street is quiet except for the wind through the elevated tracks above.`,
