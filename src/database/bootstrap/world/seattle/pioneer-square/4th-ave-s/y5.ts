  description: `Fourth Avenue runs along Pioneer Square's eastern edge here, the boundary between the historic district and the International District—or what's left of it. The fallen Chinatown Gate has blocked all eastward passage since the burning, its debris and the subsequent building collapses creating an impassable wall that runs the length of this block.

The collapsed building to the west also dominates the view, its rubble pile rising higher than some of the intact structures nearby. Between the two disaster zones, Fourth Avenue remains passable north-south, a corridor between destruction.

The avenue itself shows signs that someone has tried to maintain it—debris pushed to the sides, the worst obstacles cleared. The effort is minimal but consistent. Someone still uses this route.`,
