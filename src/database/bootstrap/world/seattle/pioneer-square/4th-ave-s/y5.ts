  description: `Fourth Avenue climbs slightly here as it approaches Washington Street, following the natural grade of the land. The incline is barely perceptible—a few degrees at most—but legs feel what eyes miss. This was a hillside once, before streets were graded and buildings were built. The hill remembers, even if the city forgot.

The collapsed building to the west dominates the view, its rubble pile rising higher than some of the intact structures nearby. The collapse created a permanent landmark, a monument to failure that everyone navigates around. The rubble has stabilized over the decades, no longer shifting, the physics of destruction having reached equilibrium.

The eastern side of the avenue shows life—or at least the infrastructure of life. A building has been partially cleared of debris, its lower floor swept, its windows patched with whatever materials were available. Someone is trying here.`,
