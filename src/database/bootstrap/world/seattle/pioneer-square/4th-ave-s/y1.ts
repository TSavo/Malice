  description: `The International District proper begins here, the boundary with Pioneer Square now behind. The architecture shifts, the brick warehouses giving way to smaller buildings with ornate facades and bilingual signage. The style is different but the emptiness is the same.

A dumpling house sits on the corner, its hand-painted sign promising the best xiaolongbao in Seattle. The kitchen is dark. The steamers are cold. The soup inside the dumplings evaporated long ago, leaving behind dried husks of what was once sublime.

A community bulletin board stands on the sidewalk, still covered with flyers for events that never happened. ESL classes. Citizenship workshops. Lunar New Year celebrations. The paper has yellowed. The thumbtacks are rusting. The community has dispersed.

A red mailbox stands at the curb, its collection times still posted. The mail stopped. The box remains, waiting for letters that will never come.`,
