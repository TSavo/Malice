  name: '4th Ave S',
  description: `Fourth Avenue marks Pioneer Square's eastern edge. The International District lies beyond—its buildings visible, its bilingual signage still legible—but unreachable. The fallen Chinatown Gate and subsequent structural collapses have created an impassable debris wall blocking all eastward passage.

Through gaps in the rubble, you can see a dumpling house with a hand-painted sign promising the best xiaolongbao in Seattle. The kitchen is dark. The steamers are cold. You can't get there from here.

A community bulletin board stands on the sidewalk, still covered with flyers for events that never happened. ESL classes. Citizenship workshops. Lunar New Year celebrations. The paper has yellowed. The thumbtacks are rusting.

Fourth Avenue continues north toward Washington Street and south toward Main. East is blocked.`,
