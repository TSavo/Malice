  name: '4th Ave S',
  description: `Fourth Avenue marks Pioneer Square's eastern boundary here. To the east, the International District is visible but unreachable—the fallen Chinatown Gate and subsequent building collapses have blocked all passage. The debris wall runs continuously, an impassable barrier of brick, timber, and concrete.

A Buddhist temple occupies a converted storefront on the west side, its modest facade giving no hint of the sanctuary within. Through the window, a golden Buddha statue is visible, still seated in meditation, still radiating calm into an empty room. Incense ash covers the altar. The offerings of oranges have mummified.

A newspaper box stands on the corner, still holding copies of the International Examiner. The headline announces something that mattered then. The paper is free now. No one takes it.

Jackson Street intersection is visible to the south. North and south along Fourth Avenue remain passable. East is a wall.`,
