  description: `A Buddhist temple occupies a converted storefront here, its modest facade giving no hint of the sanctuary within. Through the window, a golden Buddha statue is visible, still seated in meditation, still radiating calm into an empty room. Incense ash covers the altar. The offerings of oranges have mummified.

Next door, a Vietnamese sandwich shop displays its menu board, the bánh mì combinations still listed with their prices. The bread went stale months ago. The pickled vegetables fermented past edibility. The menu remains, a catalog of lunches that will never be eaten.

A newspaper box stands on the corner, still holding copies of the International Examiner, the community paper that served the district for decades. The headline announces something that mattered then. The paper is free now. No one takes it.

Jackson Street is visible to the south, the heart of the district.`,
