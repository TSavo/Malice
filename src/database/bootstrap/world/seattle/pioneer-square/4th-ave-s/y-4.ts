  description: `Fourth Avenue runs straight as a surveyor's line through this block, the geometry of the original plat visible in the regular lot lines and uniform setbacks. The Denny Party laid out Seattle's streets in 1853, imposing order on wilderness. The order survived the wilderness's return.

The International District's heart lies to the east—the core blocks of Chinatown, the Japanese community that was here before the internment and diminished after, the Vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s. The neighborhoods layer like geological strata, each wave leaving its mark. The marks remain visible even without the people.

A dragon lamp post stands at the corner, one of a series installed in the 1970s to mark Chinatown's boundaries. The lamp is dark now, has been dark for decades, but the dragon still coils around the post, bronze scales catching whatever light the sky provides.`,
