// 4th Ave S - between S. Jackson and S. Main

  name: '4th Ave S',
  description: `Main Street intersection is visible to the north, where the collapsed Chinatown Gate blocks all eastward passage. The gate's remains—carved stone and painted wood—lie in a heap across the road. To the east, the International District is visible but unreachable, blocked by the debris wall that runs the length of Fourth Avenue.

Fourth Avenue is Pioneer Square's eastern boundary, the last passable north-south route. The blocked eastward streets funnel all traffic along this corridor, though "traffic" is too generous a word for the handful of scavengers who still move through.

Buildings on the west side show Victorian brick and warehouse architecture. The east side is rubble and the impassable barrier that separates Pioneer Square from everything beyond.`,
