  description: `The heart of the International District surrounds you now, Pioneer Square just a memory to the north. The buildings here are older, built by immigrants who came to Seattle when Seattle was still becoming something. They built for permanence. They built well.

A dim sum palace occupies half the block, its dragon-painted facade still magnificent despite the grime. The rolling carts inside are frozen in place, their contents long since claimed by time and vermin. The lazy susan tables still hold plastic menus, their photos of gleaming dishes a cruel reminder of abundance.

A feng shui compass is painted on the sidewalk outside, its Chinese characters marking the cardinal directions. The compass was meant to bring luck to the businesses here. The luck ran out. The compass remains, pointing at nothing.

The elevated tracks hum overhead when the wind blows right. It sounds almost like trains.`,
