  description: `Main Street is visible to the north, the intersection where Fourth Avenue crosses one of Pioneer Square's primary east-west axes. The Chinatown Gate stands at that intersection—or stood, before it fell across the road during the burning, blocking the route to downtown. The gate's remains are visible from here, carved stone and painted wood collapsed into rubble.

The blocked intersection funnels traffic away from this stretch of Fourth Avenue, making it quieter than the parallel routes. The quiet has a weight to it, the absence of sound as present as sound itself. Even footsteps seem muffled here.

Buildings on both sides show the mixed heritage of the transitional zone—Victorian brick next to 1950s concrete, Chinese signage next to English, the jumbled timeline of a city that was always building over itself.`,
