  description: `Yesler Way lies just ahead, the intersection where Fourth Avenue would cross into downtown if the way weren't blocked. The Chinatown Gate's collapse made this a dead end for through traffic decades ago. The gate was built in the 1970s as a symbol of the neighborhood's identity—red-painted wood and carved stone in the style of traditional Chinese ceremonial gates. Its fall during the burning was accidental, probably, but the symbolism was hard to ignore.

The rubble of the gate has been partially cleared over the years, pushed to the sides to create a narrow passage on foot. Larger debris remains where it fell, too heavy to move without equipment that no longer exists. The carved dragons that once guarded the top of the gate lie broken among the stones, their painted scales faded to grey.

Fourth Avenue ends here in any practical sense. The city continues beyond, but not this route. Not anymore.`,
