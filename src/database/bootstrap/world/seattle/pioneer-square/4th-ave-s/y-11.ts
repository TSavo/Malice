  description: `Fourth Avenue runs along Pioneer Square's eastern edge here, the last passable north-south route before the debris wall. To the east, the International District's buildings are visible but unreachable—the fallen Chinatown Gate's collapse triggered a chain of structural failures that blocked all eastward streets. The wall of rubble is continuous and impassable.

The southern edge of the Condemned Block ends nearby to the northwest, its fence marking the toxic zone. Whatever contaminated that area, the boundary is clear. On one side, toxic decay. On the other, merely abandonment.

A convenience store occupies the corner, its windows boarded but its door intact. Someone has been inside recently—the boards can be moved. Convenience stores were picked clean early.

S. King Street intersection is visible to the south. Fourth Avenue continues north and south. East is a dead end.`,
