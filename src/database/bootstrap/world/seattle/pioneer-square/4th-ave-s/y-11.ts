  description: `The southern edge of the Condemned Block ends here, its fence turning west toward the interior of Pioneer Square. Whatever contaminated that area, the boundary is clear. On one side, decay. On the other, merely abandonment. There's a difference, though it's hard to articulate.

A convenience store occupies the corner, its windows boarded but its door intact. Someone has been inside recently—the boards over the door can be moved. Whether they found anything worth taking is unknown. Convenience stores were picked clean early.

The International District continues to the east, its character shifting as it approaches the industrial areas near the stadiums. The stadiums are visible in the distance, their massive forms unchanged, their purpose obsolete.

S. King Street is visible to the south, marking the edge of Pioneer Square's grid.`,
