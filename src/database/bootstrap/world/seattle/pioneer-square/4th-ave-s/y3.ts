  description: `An Asian grocery store takes up most of the block on the International District side, its windows plastered with faded sale signs in three languages. The produce section visible through the glass has become a terrarium of mold and decomposition, nature reclaiming what was always hers.

The building on the Pioneer Square side is newer, a mixed-use development that was supposed to bridge the two neighborhoods. Apartments above, retail below. The retail never fully leased. The apartments were half-occupied when everything stopped. Lights still come on in some windows at night, solar batteries discharging into empty rooms.

A basketball hoop is mounted on a pole at the edge of a small plaza, its net rotted away, its backboard tagged with graffiti. Someone left a ball nearby, deflated and cracked. The game ended mid-play and never resumed.

The elevated tracks cast their shadows across the street.`,
