  description: `Fourth Avenue marks the eastern boundary of Pioneer Square, where the historic district's preservation zone gives way to the International District's different character. The architecture here has always been transitional—buildings that belong to neither neighborhood fully, serving both with equal indifference.

The condemned block is visible to the west, its toxic reputation keeping even the most desperate scavengers at bay. The eastern side offers safer passage, buildings that are merely abandoned rather than actively dangerous. The distinction matters when every decision carries risk.

A railroad viaduct once crossed Fourth Avenue here, carrying freight trains to and from the waterfront. The viaduct was demolished in the 2010s, replaced by nothing. The support pillars remain, orphaned columns that once held something up. They hold up only themselves now.`,
