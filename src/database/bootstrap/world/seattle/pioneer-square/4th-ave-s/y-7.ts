  description: `The condemned block's eastern edge runs parallel to Fourth Avenue here, separated by a single row of buildings that serves as a buffer between the toxic zone and the street. The buffer buildings are empty—too close to the contamination for comfort, too intact to demolish. They stand as a wall between the bad and the worse.

Faded warning signs are visible on the side streets leading west, their messages still legible despite decades of weather: DANGER - CONTAMINATED AREA - NO ENTRY. The warnings were posted by authorities that no longer exist, enforced by systems that no longer function. The danger presumably remains.

Fourth Avenue itself feels cleaner here, the pavement less damaged, the buildings less decayed. Perhaps the proximity to danger kept people away, reducing the wear of occupation. Perhaps it's just random variation. The city's ruin is uneven.`,
