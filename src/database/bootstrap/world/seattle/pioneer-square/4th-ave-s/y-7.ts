  description: `The Condemned Block is visible to the west, its toxic warning signs bright against the grey buildings. Whatever happened there, it happened fast and it happened badly. The fences around it are serious—razor wire, biohazard symbols, warnings in multiple languages. People stay away.

On the eastern side of the avenue, life continues in a way. A scrap metal dealer has set up operations in an old warehouse, piles of copper and aluminum visible through gaps in the fence. Someone is still trading here, still finding value in what others abandon.

The smell from the Condemned Block carries on certain winds. Chemical and organic at once. The kind of smell that makes you breathe shallow and walk fast.

The light rail tracks at street level are covered in debris and weeds. The trains haven't run this way in a long time.`,
