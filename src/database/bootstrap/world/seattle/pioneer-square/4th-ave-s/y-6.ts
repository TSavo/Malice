  description: `South of Jackson, Fourth Avenue takes on a different character. The tourist-friendly International District gives way to something more functional. Warehouses and wholesalers. Businesses that served restaurants and grocery stores throughout the region. The supply chain, broken at every link.

A produce distribution center occupies the block to the east, its loading docks empty, its refrigeration units silent. The last shipment of bok choy and daikon rotted in place. The smell lingered for weeks before fading to something merely unpleasant.

Across the avenue, a building supply store sits dark behind its chain-link fence. Lumber and drywall and bags of concrete, all the materials needed to build something new. The materials wait. No one is building.

The elevated tracks end at a station to the north. South of here, the trains ran at street level. The tracks are embedded in the pavement, rusting.`,
