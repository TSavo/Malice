  description: `A bank building anchors the corner, one of those institutions that served the immigrant community when mainstream banks wouldn't. Remittances to Vietnam, to China, to the Philippines—money flowing back to families who depended on it. The money stopped flowing. The families stopped receiving. The building remains, its vault full of currency that measures nothing.

Across the street, a karaoke bar sits dark and silent. The neon signs that once blazed with Chinese characters are dead, their tubes filled with inert gas that no longer glows. The song books inside are still arranged on tables, waiting for voices that will never sing.

A pay phone stands on the corner, its receiver dangling. Someone tried to call home. Someone didn't get an answer. Someone walked away and left the phone off the hook.

The elevated tracks overhead are beginning to rust.`,
