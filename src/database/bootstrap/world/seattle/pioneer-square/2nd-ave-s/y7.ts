  description: `The debris at Yesler Way is visible ahead, a wall of destruction that blocks the intersection. The collapse that created it is easier to see from here, the way the building folded in on itself before spilling into the street.

A restaurant on the corner had a view of the collapse. The windows are shattered. The tables are covered with dust and debris. The view has become the ruin.

A bicycle is locked to a rack, its frame twisted, its owner presumably somewhere underneath the rubble ahead. The lock holds. The bike waits for a rider who won't return.`,
