// 2nd Ave S - between S. Washington and Yesler Way

  name: '2nd Ave S',
  description: `The avenue continues north from S. Washington toward the wall of debris at Yesler Way. The damage to buildings increases here, proximity to the collapse having taken its toll.

A hotel stands on the corner, its windows shattered, its lobby visible through gaps in the facade. The hotel offered rooms to visitors who wanted to experience Pioneer Square. The experience has changed. The rooms are uninhabitable.

A neon sign hangs at an angle from the hotel's facade, its tubes shattered, its message incomplete. HOTEL, it used to say. Now it says nothing.`,
