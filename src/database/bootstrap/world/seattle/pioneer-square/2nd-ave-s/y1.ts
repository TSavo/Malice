  description: `North of S. Main, the Corp barrier finally ends, and Second Avenue returns to something like its original character. The west side shows buildings again—1890s brick, 1920s stone, the layered geology of Pioneer Square's commercial district. The transition feels like waking up from something, that wall of black fabric giving way to windows and doorways and the familiar vocabulary of streets that were built to be walked.

The MUTUAL LIFE BUILDING rises at the corner, six stories of glazed terra cotta and Chicago-style windows, the kind of commercial architecture that announced professionalism before glass curtain walls made announcements unnecessary. The building held accountants and insurance adjusters and notaries public, the paper-shufflers who kept commerce lubricated. Through the windows you can see cubicles and phones and desk calendars still showing months that have passed. The calculators on those desks are solar-powered. They'd still work if someone cared about the math.

Parking meters line the curb like a row of single-stemmed flowers, their heads at uniform height, their coin slots uniformly jammed. The city raised rates to $6 an hour before the end, trying to balance budgets that would never balance again. The meters still show TIME EXPIRED on their faces, red flags that meant something when parking enforcement existed. The tickets that would have been issued sit unwritten. The revenue sits uncollected. The meters stand at attention for an inspection that will never come.`,
