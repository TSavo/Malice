  description: `The avenue continues north from S. Main, the construction zone yielding to older buildings on the west side. The transition is abrupt, black fabric giving way to brick, mystery yielding to the familiar decay of Pioneer Square.

An office building stands on the corner, its windows dark, its tenants vanished. The building housed accountants and lawyers and people who pushed paper for a living. The paper has stopped being pushed. The living has stopped.

A parking meter stands at the curb, its face cracked, its time expired. The meter demanded quarters. The quarters are worthless. The demand continues.`,
