  description: `Standing here, you can feel the scale of the Corp project—the fence stretches north and south as far as the buildings allow you to see, and the site extends west for blocks, swallowing what used to be surface lots and warehouses and a building or two that the historical society tried to save. The scale suggests something institutional. A hospital. A campus. A data center large enough to process the thoughts of a small nation. The permits never specified. The fence never opened. The scale just kept growing until it stopped.

MORRISON & FOERSTER, CONSTRUCTION LAW reads a brass plate beside a door on the east side—lawyers who specialized in building disputes, delays, defects, the endless litigation that follows when concrete meets ambition. The irony of practicing construction law across from the city's most mysterious construction project presumably wasn't lost on them. The disputes have been permanently settled now. Not by lawyers.

A fire hydrant stands at the curb, painted yellow in accordance with Seattle Municipal Code—the city standardized on yellow after the Great Fire of 1889, when firefighters couldn't find hydrants in the smoke and flame. The hydrant's paint has faded to the color of old mustard. The valve hasn't been turned in months. Whatever's in the pipes beneath the street—water or air or nothing—stays there, under pressure or not, waiting for fires that will have to burn themselves out.`,
