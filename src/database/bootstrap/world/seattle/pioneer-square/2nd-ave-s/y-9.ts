  description: `Second Avenue runs straight and wide through this block, a proper arterial compared to the pedestrian scale of Occidental. The buildings here are larger, more institutional—banks and office buildings that needed the gravitas of a major street address. The gravitas survives in stone and brick even if the institutions don't.

The pavement shows the characteristic cracking of freeze-thaw cycles working on asphalt for decades without maintenance. Weeds have exploited every fissure, their roots widening cracks into crevasses. In some places the asphalt has heaved entirely, creating miniature ridges that would destroy a car's suspension. No cars to worry about anymore.

A traffic signal dangles from its wire overhead, swaying slightly in whatever breeze finds its way between the buildings. The lights are dead, have been dead for decades. The signal still points in directions that once mattered.`,
