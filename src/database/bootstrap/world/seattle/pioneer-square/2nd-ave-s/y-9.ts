  description: `The avenue runs north from S. King Street, passing through the eastern edge of the stadium district. The light rail tracks run overhead here, elevated above the street, their trains frozen on the rails like toys abandoned mid-play.

A parking structure dominates the east side of the street, its levels visible through open sides. The structure served stadium crowds. The crowds are gone. The structure remains, a monument to parking that no one needs.

A pay station stands at the entrance, its screen displaying instructions that assume someone is reading them.`,
