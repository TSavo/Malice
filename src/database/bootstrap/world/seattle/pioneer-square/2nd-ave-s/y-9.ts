// 2nd Ave S - between S. King and S. Jackson

  name: '2nd Ave S',
  description: `Second Avenue runs north through the shadow of the Link Light Rail's elevated track, a ribbon of steel and concrete that carries trains between SeaTac and Capitol Hill—or carried them, before the trains stopped and the power failed and the whole system became a linear sculpture of frozen expectation. A train sits visible on the track above, its articulated cars straddling a curve, windows dark, passengers presumably evacuated or absorbed into whatever happened next. The train has been there long enough for birds to nest in its undercarriage.

A parking garage fills the east side of the street, five levels of open-sided concrete designed to absorb the flood of cars that arrived for Mariners games. The structure's geometry is pure function—ramps spiraling upward, slots sized for SUVs and sedans, painted lines and arrows directing traffic that will never flow. A few cars remain on the upper levels, visible through the open walls like fish in an aquarium. Their owners didn't make it back. Or chose not to return. Or stopped existing in ways that don't leave cars behind.

The pay station at the entrance still displays its rates—$40 EVENT PARKING, $15 DAILY MAX—prices calculated for an economy that traded in dollars. The screen has frozen on PLEASE INSERT PAYMENT, a request that will never be honored. The gate arm is up. Nobody is enforcing anything anymore.`,
