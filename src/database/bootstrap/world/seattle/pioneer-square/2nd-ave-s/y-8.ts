  description: `The Corp Construction zone begins here on the west side of the street, its black fabric barriers marking the edge of the mystery. The zone extends for blocks to the north and west, whatever they were building hidden behind opaque screens.

A gap in the fence has been cut and patched and cut again, the chain-link telling a story of curiosity that wouldn't be denied. The curiosity is understandable. The zone was always suspicious, even before.

A security camera points at the street from a pole, its lens dusty, its recordings unwatched.`,
