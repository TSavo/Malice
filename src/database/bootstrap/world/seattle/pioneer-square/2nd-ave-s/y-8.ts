  description: `A parking garage occupies most of the eastern block face, its concrete ramps spiraling up into darkness. The structure was built in the 1960s, brutalist in the way that parking garages always are—function over form, cars over people. The cars are gone now. The brutalism remains.

The garage entrance gapes open, its mechanical gate frozen in the raised position. Beyond the entrance, shadows pool between the support columns. The structure creaks occasionally, concrete settling or wind finding its way through the levels above. The sound echoes in ways that make it hard to locate.

Across the street, a row of storefronts shows the archaeology of commercial failure—a coffee shop, a print shop, a place that sold mobile phones. Each successive business painted over its predecessor's signage without quite obscuring it, creating palimpsests of commerce.`,
