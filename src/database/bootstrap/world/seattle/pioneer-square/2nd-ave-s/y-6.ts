// 2nd Ave S - between S. King and S. Jackson

  description: `S. Jackson Street opens ahead, the intersection that marks the boundary between Pioneer Square and the International District. Chinatown is just blocks east—you can see the pagoda-style phone booth at the corner, the red-and-gold signage of restaurants that served dim sum to crowds that spilled out of stadium gates. The Corp barrier cuts west, following property lines that lawyers negotiated and engineers surveyed, a boundary that makes perfect sense on paper and no sense at all on the ground.

A Metro bus shelter stands at the corner, its curved glass walls protecting advertisements from rain that doesn't fall and commuters who don't wait. The ads are for services that require functioning infrastructure—banking apps, streaming subscriptions, insurance policies, the endless commerce of normal life. A movie poster promises COMING SOON. The movie presumably came. Whether anyone saw it is another question entirely. The bus stop's digital display shows NO BUSES SCHEDULED, which is either a technical error or brutal honesty depending on your interpretation.

A light pole has become a vertical palimpsest, layers of flyers and stickers accumulated over years of taping and posting and covering and taping again. Somewhere in those layers: a lost dog named Bruno with a reward offered, band stickers from groups that never got famous, a QR code linking to a petition that gathered signatures for something that mattered once. The paper has weathered into illegibility. The layers fuse together in the rain. History compresses into mulch.`,
