// 2nd Ave S - between S. King and S. Jackson

  description: `S. Jackson Street is just ahead, its intersection marking the edge of the International District to the east. The construction zone continues to the west, its boundary following property lines that made sense on blueprints.

A bus stop shelter stands at the corner, its advertisements for products that no longer exist faded but readable. The buses don't stop here anymore. The advertisements continue their appeals.

A light pole has been decorated with stickers and flyers, layers of announcements for concerts and protests and lost pets. The concerts are cancelled. The protests are moot. The pets remain lost.`,
