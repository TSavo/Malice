// 2nd Ave S - between S. Main and S. Washington

  description: `S. Washington opens ahead, and beyond it the street continues toward Yesler Way and the debris wall that terminates everything. You can feel the proximity to the collapse here—the buildings show cracks that radiate from window corners, the kind of damage that happens when the ground shakes wrong or when pressure waves travel through stone. Some windows have been boarded over from inside. Some just gape, glass long since fallen to the sidewalk and swept into gutters or crunching underfoot.

LUCKY CORNER MARKET reads the hand-painted sign above a bodega that served the neighborhood's quick needs—Takis and Swisher Sweets and King County Metro passes and scratch tickets that promised jackpots in six figures. The door hangs open, propped by a brick that used to keep it from closing on customers. Through the doorway: shelves half-empty from looting or purchasing or just the slow attrition of supply chains that stopped supplying. The scratch tickets are still in their dispensers. The jackpots remain unclaimed. The odds haven't changed—they just apply to a different kind of luck now.

A fire escape has torn away from the building above the market, its lowest flight dangling at sixty degrees, bolts pulled from brick that wasn't strong enough to hold it. The escape ends ten feet above the sidewalk now, ladder unreachable, the whole apparatus transformed from safety feature to hazard. The building it served is still standing, for whatever standing is worth when the stairs that should save you are the stairs that might kill you.`,
