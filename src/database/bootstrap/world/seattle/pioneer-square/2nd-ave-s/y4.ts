  description: `S. Washington Street is just ahead, its intersection marking the approach to Yesler Way and the debris that blocks northward travel. The buildings here show damage, cracks in the facades, broken windows, the physical evidence of whatever happened.

A corner store sold snacks and cigarettes and lottery tickets, the small commerce of urban life. The store is dark. The lottery has been cancelled. The prizes are unclaimed.

A fire escape has partially collapsed on one building, its iron stairs dangling at an angle that suggests the rest might follow. The building underneath continues standing, for now.`,
