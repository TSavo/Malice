  description: `The Corp Construction barrier looms to the west, black fabric stretched between metal poles, blocking sight of whatever they're building—or hiding—behind it. The barrier appeared years ago and hasn't moved since. No construction sounds emerge. No workers enter or leave during daylight. The project continues in silence and secrecy.

Armed guards patrol the barrier's perimeter at irregular intervals, their routes unpredictable, their weapons visible. They don't engage with passersby unless approached. The message is clear without words: this belongs to someone else now.

On the eastern side of the avenue, buildings stand open and abandoned, their interiors visible through broken windows. The contrast is stark—corporate control on one side, urban decay on the other. Second Avenue has become a boundary between worlds.`,
