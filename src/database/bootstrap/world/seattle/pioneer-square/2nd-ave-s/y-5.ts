  description: `The Corp barrier continues its march north, unbroken by gates or gaps along this stretch, the black fabric pulled taut against the chain-link like skin stretched over bones. Whatever's behind that barrier swallowed real estate that used to hold buildings—addresses that used to exist, businesses that used to operate, lives that used to be lived in those spaces. The barrier covers the absence like a bandage covers a wound.

DESC—DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL AND HEALTH SERVICES reads the sign above a building on the east side, the letters faded to grey on a ground that used to be blue. Through the window: cubicles and filing cabinets and the infrastructure of helping people who needed help. Forms are scattered across the floor inside, intake paperwork and benefit applications and the bureaucratic detritus of a system that tried. The system stopped trying. The paperwork remains, filled out or half-filled-out or blank, the needs they documented still existing somewhere in bodies that still need.

A shopping cart leans against the Corp fence, packed with the portable archaeology of a life lived outdoors—sleeping bag rolled tight, plastic tarp folded into a square, cans and bottles sorted into separate bags for redemption at machines that don't accept anything anymore. The cart's owner is gone, but the cart itself is a testament to survival strategies that worked for a while. Whoever pushed it here knew how to make do. They just didn't know what was coming.`,
