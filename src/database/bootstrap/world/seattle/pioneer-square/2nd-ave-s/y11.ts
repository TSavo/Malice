// 2nd Ave S - approaching Yesler Way

  description: `Yesler Way lies just ahead, the diagonal street that slices across the grid at an angle that never quite made sense. The intersection was always awkward for navigation, streets meeting at angles that created triangular lots and confused tourists. The confusion persists without the tourists.

The buildings here are scarred from the burning—upper floors blackened, windows blown out, facades pocked with damage that might be shrapnel or might be something else. The lower levels remain largely intact, protected by the mass of the structures themselves. Brick and stone absorbed what they could. Glass and wood didn't.

A faded poster clings to a lamp post, advertising an event from before—a concert, a festival, something that brought people together. The date is illegible, worn away by weather. The event happened or didn't. Either way, it's over now.`,
