  name: '2nd Ave S',
  description: `Main Street is visible ahead, the cross-axis that once defined Pioneer Square's commercial center. The buildings on either side of Second Avenue grow more ornate as the intersection approaches—architects competing for attention at the neighborhood's busiest corner. The competition continued until there was no one left to impress.

A bank building dominates the western corner, its marble facade projecting the permanence that financial institutions once claimed. The brass doors are tarnished green, their handles worn smooth by generations of hands that reached for money. The money is still inside, theoretically. It means nothing now.

The streetscape shows evidence of the last days—barriers that were erected and abandoned, sandbags that have rotted into piles of mud and fabric, a burned-out vehicle pushed to the curb and left to rust. The archaeology of collapse, preserved in place.`,
