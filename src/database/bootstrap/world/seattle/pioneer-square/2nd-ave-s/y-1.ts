// 2nd Ave S - between S. Jackson and S. Main

  description: `S. Main Street is just ahead, its intersection marking the boundary between the Corp Construction zone and Pioneer Square's commercial core. The construction fence ends somewhere near the intersection, yielding to older buildings.

A bank building stands at the corner, its marble facade projecting stability that turned out to be unstable. The vault is locked. The deposits are inaccessible. The stability was always theoretical.

A clock on the bank's facade has stopped at some moment that seemed ordinary when it happened. The moment has been preserved. The ordinariness has become extraordinary.`,
