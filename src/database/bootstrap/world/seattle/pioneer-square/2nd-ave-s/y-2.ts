  description: `A small plaza opens up on the east side of the street, a pocket of public space carved out of the urban grid. The plaza has benches and a few scraggly trees and the kind of hopeful landscaping that never quite thrives in shade.

The construction fence forms the west wall of the plaza, black fabric turning the space into a dead end rather than a through-way. The plaza was probably nicer before they started building.

A dedication plaque names the plaza after someone who donated money or land or influence. The donation is commemorated. The someone is forgotten.`,
