  description: `The Corp barrier continues unbroken, that endless wall of black fabric making the west side of Second Avenue feel like a street with only one side. Permits are posted at intervals—City of Seattle Department of Construction and Inspection notices dating back years, each one stamped and signed and properly filed with bureaucracies that existed to file things properly. COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION. EXCAVATION PERMIT. CRANE OPERATION. The permits tell you nothing about what the construction was for. They never did.

JACKSON STREET MARKET occupies the ground floor of a brick building on the east side, one of those convenience stores that served the construction crews—energy drinks and cigarettes and instant noodles, the consumables that fuel building things. The windows are dark. The neon OPEN sign has burned out. Through the glass you can see racks of snacks that have passed their expiration dates by enough months that eating them would be either adventurous or suicidal, depending on your relationship with risk.

A row of porta-potties lines the curb in front of the Corp barrier, blue plastic boxes that served workers who needed to relieve themselves between demolition and construction. One door hangs open, swinging occasionally in the wind, revealing an interior that has achieved a state of equilibrium with its environment. The smell is less than you'd expect. Chemistry does its work. Time does the rest.`,
