  description: `The condemned block to the east casts a pall over this stretch of Second Avenue. Whatever contamination seeped into the ground there—chemical, biological, the rumors vary—it keeps even the desperate away. The buildings on the avenue's western side seem to lean away from it, though that's probably just settling foundations.

A chain-link fence once cordoned off the condemned area, but sections have been cut or pulled down over the years. Warning signs still cling to the remaining posts, their skulls-and-crossbones faded but legible. The warnings were serious once. They might still be.

The street surface here is stained with something that leached from the east side during rains—a discoloration that resists weathering, darker than the surrounding asphalt. People walk around it instinctively, even those who don't know what it is.`,
