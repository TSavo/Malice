  description: `The construction fence continues along the west side, its black fabric interrupted only by warning signs and the occasional official notice. The notices are dated months ago, permits and approvals from a bureaucracy that no longer functions.

A convenience store on the east side served the construction workers who built whatever is behind the fence. The workers are gone. The store is dark. The energy drinks have gone flat.

A porta-potty stands at the curb, its door swinging open in the wind, its interior best left uninspected.`,
