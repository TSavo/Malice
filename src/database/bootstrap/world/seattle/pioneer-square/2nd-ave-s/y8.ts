  description: `The rubble field begins here, spilling into the street from the collapsed building ahead. Walking becomes difficult, the asphalt covered with bricks and glass and the fragments of a structure that stood for over a century.

A car has been crushed by a section of facade, its roof flattened, its windows blown out. The car was parked legally, its meter probably still showing time remaining when the building fell.

The smell here is different. Dust and decay and something else. The collapse disturbed more than just brick and mortar.`,
