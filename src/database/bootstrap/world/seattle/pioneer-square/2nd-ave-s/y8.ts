  description: `From here you can see how the building fell—not straight down in the controlled manner of demolition, but outward and sideways, the upper floors sliding off the lower ones like a deck of cards pushed from one end. The collapse happened in stages, you can tell from the way the debris is layered. First the facade peeled away. Then the floors pancaked. Then the whole mass slumped forward into the intersection, filling the street with the compressed remains of a century of occupation.

DELICATUS occupied the corner restaurant space, one of those upscale sandwich shops that charged $18 for a pastrami and justified it with locally-sourced this and house-made that. The front windows have been blown out, whether by the shockwave or by flying debris or by someone seeking shelter or supplies. Through the empty frames: tables still set for lunch, white paper covering red-checkered cloth, chairs scattered but not overturned, dust coating everything like grey snow. The menu board on the wall still lists specials. The specials have expired.

A bicycle rack stands at the corner, still bolted to the concrete, still doing its job. Three bikes remain locked to it—a commuter hybrid, a fixie with deep-dish rims, a folding bike with tiny wheels. One of the bikes has been bent at the top tube, frame warped by something heavy that hit it and bounced away. The locks hold. The owners don't collect what they locked up. The bikes wait with the patience of objects, which is infinite and indifferent.`,
