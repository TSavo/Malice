  description: `The debris spills into the street here, the leading edge of the collapse zone spreading outward like a frozen wave. Walking becomes picking—stepping over bricks, around rebar, past chunks of concrete that used to be floors or walls or the distinction between them. The asphalt beneath is cracked and buckled, stressed by the weight of everything that fell on it. Glass crunches under every step. Some of it is window glass, tempered and safety. Some of it is decorative, cut crystal from chandeliers or mirrors from vanities, the finer things scattered among the debris like ironic commentary.

A Prius has been flattened by a section of facade that landed squarely on its roof, compressing the passenger compartment to maybe eighteen inches. The hybrid's hood is crumpled but the front wheels are still pointed straight ahead, the car still aimed at wherever it was going when going stopped being an option. A parking meter stands next to it, undamaged, its display showing thirty-seven minutes remaining. The meter outlasted the car. The meter will outlast a lot of things.

The smell is different this close to the collapse. Dust, yes—the powdered concrete and pulverized brick that coats your lungs if you breathe too deep. But underneath that: the organic smell of things that lived and stopped living, the slow chemistry of decomposition that happens when moisture and darkness and time get together with whatever was inside the building when it came down. You don't want to think about what that smell means. You think about it anyway.`,
