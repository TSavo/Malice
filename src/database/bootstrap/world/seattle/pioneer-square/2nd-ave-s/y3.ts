  description: `The King County Administration Building fills the east side of the block, a mid-century municipal fortress of precast concrete and tinted glass, the kind of architecture that says "government" the way other buildings say "bank" or "church." The county processed everything here—permits for dogs and buildings and marriages, licenses for businesses and vehicles and professions, the endless paperwork that made civic life legible. The windows are dark. The permits are unissued. The licenses have all expired, including the license to govern.

A food cart's spot is marked by a rectangle of cleaner pavement, the space where a vendor parked their halal cart or taco truck or whatever was trending that season. Government workers lined up here at noon, choosing between lamb shawarma and carnitas, small decisions that felt significant when you only got thirty minutes for lunch. The vendor's absence leaves a hole in the day that doesn't exist anymore. The rectangle of clean pavement is already being colonized by grime. Soon it will match the rest of the street, and the only evidence of the cart will be the memory of it.

A flagpole rises in front of the Administration Building, aluminum and hollow, its rope slapping against the pole in the wind with a sound like irregular applause. The flag is gone—torn away by weather or taken by someone who wanted it or just fallen and never retrieved. The clips at the top of the rope dangle empty, waiting to be attached to something that represents something. The pole stands ready. The representation has lapsed.`,
