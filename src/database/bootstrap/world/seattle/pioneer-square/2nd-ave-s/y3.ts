  description: `The County Administration Building is visible to the east, its government facade projecting the authority of a government that no longer governs. The building processed permits and licenses and the paperwork of civic life. The processing has stopped. The paperwork remains, unfiled.

A food cart spot is marked by a different color of asphalt, the place where a vendor served lunch to government workers. The workers are gone. The spot remains, waiting for a cart that won't return.

A flagpole stands in front of the building, its rope slapping against the metal. The flag is gone.`,
