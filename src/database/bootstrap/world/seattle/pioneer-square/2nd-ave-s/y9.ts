  description: `Yesler Way is just ahead, and with it the impassable wall of debris that blocks all northward travel on this avenue. The collapse fills the intersection completely, rising three stories high, a monument to destruction.

A fire truck sits abandoned at the edge of the debris, its ladder extended toward something that no longer exists. The firefighters who responded are gone, their fate unclear, their truck left where they left it.

A warning fence has been erected, orange plastic mesh stretched between metal posts. The fence marks the edge of the debris field. Beyond it, there is no passage. There is only rubble.`,
