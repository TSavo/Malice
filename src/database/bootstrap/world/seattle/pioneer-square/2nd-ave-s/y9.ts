// 2nd Ave S - between S. Washington and Yesler Way

  description: `Yesler Way ends here in a wall of rubble that rises three stories high, a dam of brick and steel and shattered concrete that blocks the intersection as completely as if someone had built it there on purpose. The debris reaches from building face to building face, filling the street like a mold, leaving no gap, no path, no possibility of passing through without climbing over or digging under. From street level, you can't see what's on the other side. From street level, there might as well not be another side.

A fire truck sits at the edge of the debris field, Ladder Company 10's rig, its cherry-red paint dulled by dust but still visible. The ladder is extended at full reach, pointing at the rubble pile as if the firefighters were trying to climb over before they realized there was nowhere to climb to. The cab doors are open. The engine is silent. Whoever was driving made it here, deployed the ladder, and then... something else. The hoses are still racked. The axes are still mounted. The firefighters left their equipment behind when they left.

Orange plastic fencing stretches across the street, zip-tied to T-posts hammered into cracks in the asphalt, the official declaration that this is as far as you go. DANGER KEEP OUT the fence says in repeated white letters. UNSTABLE STRUCTURE. The structure has been unstable for months, maybe years, and nothing more has fallen. The warning remains accurate but irrelevant, like telling someone not to worry about the rain when they're already drowning.`,
