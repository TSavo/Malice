  description: `The Pioneer Building rises to the west, its Richardsonian Romanesque arches framing windows that once looked out on the busiest intersection in Seattle. The building has survived everything—the fire, the earthquakes, the wars, the collapse. Two hundred years of standing while the world changed around it. The stone doesn't care about history. It just endures.

Second Avenue climbs slightly toward Yesler Way, following the grade that made the original skid road possible. The incline is gentle but noticeable, especially to legs unused to elevation change. Flat ground has become the baseline. Any slope feels like effort.

A brass plaque on the Pioneer Building's corner commemorates the structure's historical significance. The plaque was installed in 1970, polished regularly by building management until there was no management to polish it. The brass has gone green. The significance remains, unread.`,
