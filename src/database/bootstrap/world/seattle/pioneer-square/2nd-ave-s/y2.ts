  description: `The architectural timeline jumps around on this block—a Romanesque Revival warehouse from 1892 sits next to a brutalist parking structure from 1974, which shoulders up against a glass-and-steel infill project from 2015. Pioneer Square's preservation district never quite figured out how to handle the gaps, the lots where buildings burned or fell or were demolished for reasons that seemed good at the time. The result is a timeline made visible, each building a chapter in a story that stopped mid-sentence.

KINKO'S—no, wait, FEDEX OFFICE now, they bought the brand—occupies the ground floor of the brutalist building, a copy shop that served the legal district's endless appetite for paper. Through the window: self-service copiers, binding machines, wide-format printers for architectural plans. The machines sit ready, power lights blinking on UPS backup that must be running on fumes by now. The 24-HOUR sign is still illuminated. The hours continue. Nobody's counting them.

A FedEx delivery truck sits abandoned at the curb, its cargo door hanging open, packages spilling onto the street. The driver made it this far, then made a choice—keep delivering, or deal with whatever was happening around them. They chose the latter. The packages remain: Amazon boxes and legal envelopes and oversized tubes that probably held blueprints for buildings that will never be built. The delivery manifest is still clipped to the dashboard. The route is half-completed. The completion is optional now.`,
