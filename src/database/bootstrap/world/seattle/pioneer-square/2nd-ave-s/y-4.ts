  description: `The International District begins to assert itself here, the architecture transitioning from Pioneer Square's Victorian brick to something more utilitarian—mid-century buildings that housed import businesses and community organizations. The transition was always gradual, one neighborhood bleeding into another without clear boundaries.

A pagoda-style phone booth stands on the corner, its distinctive roof marking the edge of Chinatown's historic territory. The phone inside hasn't worked in decades, but the booth itself remains—cast iron and cultural statement, too heavy to move, too symbolic to demolish. Someone has swept the interior recently, keeping it clean for reasons that transcend utility.

The sidewalk widens here, designed for the foot traffic that once flowed between neighborhoods. The extra width feels excessive now, empty space where crowds once navigated around each other.`,
