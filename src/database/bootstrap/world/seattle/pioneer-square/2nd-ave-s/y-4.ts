  description: `The avenue continues north from S. Jackson, the construction zone dominating the west side of the street. The fence line is unbroken here, the mystery intact, the black fabric revealing nothing of what Corp was building.

A social services office occupies a building on the east side, its mission to help people who needed help. The need continues. The help has stopped. The office is dark, its intake forms scattered on the floor inside.

A shopping cart full of belongings has been left against the construction fence, its owner gone, its contents a biography of survival.`,
