  description: `The grade steepens here as the street pulls away from sea level. Seattle was built on hills. The hills remain. The city is debatable.

A luggage repair shop occupies a narrow storefront, its window displaying suitcases in various states of disassembly. The owner fixed bags for travelers passing through the ferry terminal. The travelers have stopped passing. The bags wait, unrepaired and unclaimed.

Next door, a copy shop with faded posters advertising services. Copies. Faxes. Notary public. The machines inside are dark. The notary has notarized their last document.`,
