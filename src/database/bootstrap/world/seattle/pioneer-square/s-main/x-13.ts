// S. Main St - between Waterfront and 1st Ave

  description: `The grade intensifies here, Main Street pulling hard against gravity as it rises toward First Avenue. This stretch was always a transition zone—waterfront tourist traps giving way to the brick warehouses and iron-fronted buildings that define Pioneer Square's architectural character. The transition still happens. The tourists just don't make the climb anymore.

PIONEER LUGGAGE & LEATHER occupies a narrow storefront wedged between larger buildings, a repair shop that has served ferry commuters and travelers since 1952. The window display is a taxonomy of luggage disasters—suitcases with torn handles, briefcases with broken latches, garment bags with zipper failures, each piece tagged with a repair ticket and a customer name. The repair work was never completed. The customers never collected. Some of those bags have been waiting for years now, their owners' travel plans permanently suspended.

A FedEx Office shares the block, its windows dark, its self-service copiers and fax machines idle. A sign on the door reads OPEN 24 HOURS, the promise of perpetual availability that used to mean something. The notary desk inside still holds a stamp and a logbook, the last few entries dated months ago—mortgage documents, affidavits, the paperwork of legal lives. The notary's seal is still valid, technically. The government that issued it is less so.`,
