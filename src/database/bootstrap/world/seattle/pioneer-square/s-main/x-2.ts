  description: `Second Avenue opens ahead, the intersection visible at the end of the block. The traffic light still cycles through its colors—green to yellow to red, the automated rhythm continuing in the absence of traffic to regulate. The light was programmed to optimize flow, to minimize wait times, to serve a city that moved. The city has stopped moving. The light keeps optimizing.

PIONEER LOAN & JEWELRY occupies the corner building, a pawn shop that has served the neighborhood's desperate and optimistic since 1932. The window is a taxonomy of value exchanged: guitars pawned by musicians who needed rent money more than instruments, watches traded by collectors who needed cash more than time, wedding rings sold by people whose marriages didn't work out, the whole archaeology of financial stress rendered in gold and silver and cubic zirconia. Each item has a tag. Each tag has a number. Each number represented someone's calculation about what they could afford to lose. The calculations have become moot. The items wait behind glass for claims that aren't coming.

Three brass balls hang above the entrance, the traditional symbol of the pawnbroker's trade—allegedly derived from the Medici coat of arms, though the history is contested. The balls have gone green with verdigris. The symbol persists, even if the trade it represents has transformed from commerce into archaeology.`,
