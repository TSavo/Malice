  description: `The street continues east from Occidental Mall, leaving behind the pedestrian zone and returning to pavement. The transition is abrupt, cobblestones giving way to asphalt, charm giving way to function.

A vintage clothing store occupies the corner, its mannequins dressed in styles from decades that are now ancient history. Flapper dresses and zoot suits and things that were ironic before irony stopped being affordable. The mannequins pose in the window, frozen in attitudes of casual elegance.

Across the street, a building with a mural covering its entire side. A scene of Seattle's working waterfront, painted by someone who remembered when the waterfront worked. The colors have faded. The workers have vanished. The mural endures.`,
