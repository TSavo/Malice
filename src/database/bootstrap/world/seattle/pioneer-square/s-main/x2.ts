  description: `KING COUNTY COMMUNITY SERVICES fills the entire south side of the block, a mid-century municipal building with the architectural warmth of a filing cabinet. The building housed social workers and case managers and the bureaucratic infrastructure of compassion—SNAP applications and disability claims and the thousand forms required to prove you needed help badly enough to receive it. The revolving door is frozen mid-rotation. The lobby beyond is visible through glass walls: reception desks, waiting-area chairs, a numbered ticket dispenser. The numbers stopped being called.

A bulletin board near the entrance holds the archaeology of assistance: flyers for shelters with addresses and hours that may or may not still apply, food bank schedules printed on fluorescent paper, hotline numbers for crisis services that ring through to voicemail that fills and empties into nowhere. One flyer offers HELP FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS, another FREE LEGAL AID FOR TENANTS FACING EVICTION. The problems the flyers addressed still exist. The help the flyers offered has relocated to wherever help goes.

A shopping cart leans against the building's foundation, positioned under an overhang that offers some protection from rain. The cart is packed with the portable archaeology of a life lived without shelter—sleeping bag compressed into a stuff sack, plastic tarps folded carefully, cans and bottles sorted into bags for recycling that no longer happens. The cart's owner assembled these possessions through choices and calculations that made sense at the time. The owner is gone. The possessions remain, a memorial to survival strategies that worked until they didn't.`,
