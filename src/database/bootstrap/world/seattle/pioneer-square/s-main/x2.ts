// S. Main St - approaching 2nd Ave

  description: `Second Avenue is just ahead, its traffic lights cycling through their colors for no one. Green, yellow, red. The intersection follows rules that no longer apply.

A pawn shop occupies the corner here, its window a museum of desperation. Guitars and watches and wedding rings. The things people sold when they needed money more than memories. The pawn shop is closed. The items remain in the window, unclaimed and unreclaimed.

Three gold balls hang above the door, the universal symbol of the trade. The balls are dusty but intact. The symbol persists, even if the meaning has changed.`,
