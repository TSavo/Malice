  description: `First Avenue crosses S. Main Street at a corner that once hummed with foot traffic. Office workers and tourists and people with somewhere to be. The somewhere has emptied out. The being has stopped.

The Merchant's Cafe stands on the southwest corner, claiming to be Seattle's oldest restaurant. The claim is painted on the window in gold leaf, faded but legible. The restaurant is dark. The claim remains, uncontested by anyone who cares.

A streetlight leans at a slight angle here, bent by some impact that no one witnessed or no one survived to describe. It still works, clicking on at dusk, illuminating an intersection that no longer needs illuminating.

The intersection is clear in all directions. First Avenue runs north and south. S. Main continues east and west.`,
