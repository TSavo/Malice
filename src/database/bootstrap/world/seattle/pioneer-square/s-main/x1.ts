  description: `The street narrows slightly here, the buildings pressing in from both sides. The architecture shifts from Romanesque Revival to something plainer, more utilitarian. Function over form. The forms didn't survive anyway.

A camera shop occupies the ground floor, its window displaying equipment that was cutting-edge a decade ago and is simply equipment now. DSLRs and lenses and tripods. The digital revolution made photographers of everyone. Now no one is photographing anything.

Across the street, a travel agency with posters of destinations that might as well be other planets. Paris. Tokyo. Machu Picchu. The flights have been cancelled. The destinations wait, patient and unreachable.`,
