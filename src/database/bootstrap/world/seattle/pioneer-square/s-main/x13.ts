  description: `The buildings transition here from government concrete to private glass, the edge of the International District approaching. Signs in English give way to signs in Chinese and Vietnamese and languages that survived longer than the people who spoke them.

A dim sum restaurant occupies the corner, its menu still posted in the window, its dining room visible through glass. The tables are set with teacups and chopsticks, ready for a meal that will never be served.

Red paper lanterns hang from the ceiling inside, their color faded but their shape intact. The lanterns were for luck. The luck ran out. The lanterns remain.`,
