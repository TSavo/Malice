  description: `Main Street approaches Fourth Avenue, the eastern edge of Pioneer Square where the historic district meets the International District. The transition is visible in the signage—English-only giving way to bilingual, Victorian ornamentation giving way to practical utility. Two neighborhoods overlapping, their boundaries negotiated block by block.

The Chinatown Gate's ruins are visible to the north, its collapsed timbers blocking the intersection at Yesler. The gate's fall isolated this stretch from easy access to downtown, forcing traffic to route around through streets that weren't designed for through movement. The routing has become habit, even though the streets are empty.

A former dim sum restaurant occupies the corner, its red awning faded to pink, its gold lettering barely legible. The restaurant served generations of families, Sunday brunches stretching across tables pushed together. The tables are still inside, still pushed together, waiting for a crowd that has scattered to wherever crowds went.`,
