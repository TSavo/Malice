  description: `The architectural vocabulary shifts here as Main Street approaches the International District—government brutalism giving way to the particular vernacular of immigrant commerce. Signs appear in Chinese and Vietnamese, sometimes with English below, sometimes without. The languages on these signs survived longer than many of their speakers, the characters persisting as a kind of memorial to communities that gathered here.

JADE GARDEN occupies the corner building, a dim sum restaurant that served the neighborhood since 1981. The menu is still posted in the window, photographs of dishes numbered for easy ordering—har gow, siu mai, char siu bao, the greatest hits of Cantonese brunch. Through the window: tables set with white tablecloths and ceramic teacups, lazy susans at each table's center, the whole apparatus of communal eating frozen mid-gesture. The kitchen beyond is dark. The dim sum carts are parked against the wall. The meal service that should have started at 10 AM has been permanently delayed.

Red paper lanterns hang from the ceiling inside, their color faded from crimson to rose, their shapes still round and correct. The lanterns are symbols of prosperity and good fortune, hung for Lunar New Year and kept up because taking them down would have been bad luck. The luck didn't hold. The lanterns sway slightly when air moves through cracks in the door, their tassels dancing for an audience that isn't watching.`,
