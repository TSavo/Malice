  description: `Main Street continues east toward Third Avenue, the commercial character of the corridor thinning as it moves away from the neighborhood's core. The buildings here are smaller, less ornate—the businesses that couldn't afford Main and Second settled for Main and Third. The compromise shows in the architecture.

The Corp Construction barrier is visible to the north, its black fabric wall running parallel to the street for the entire block. Whatever they're doing behind that barrier, they're doing it quietly. The contrast between corporate activity and urban decay is stark here—resources flowing into the fenced compound while the surrounding blocks crumble.

A former coffee shop occupies one corner, its espresso machine still visible through the window. The machine was expensive once, Italian engineering meant to produce perfect shots. The shots stopped. The machine waits, corroding slowly, for a barista who will never return.`,
