  description: `The Corp Construction fence appears here, black fabric stretched over chain-link, blocking the view of whatever is happening inside. The construction zone extends for blocks, a wound in the city that was never meant to heal.

Warning signs are posted at intervals. DANGER. HARD HAT AREA. NO TRESPASSING. The warnings are redundant now. Everything is dangerous. Hard hats won't help. Trespassing implies someone to stop you.

A gap in the fence has been cut and then patched and then cut again, the chain-link telling a story of curiosity and repair and more curiosity. Someone wanted to see what was inside. Maybe they did.`,
