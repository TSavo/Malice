  description: `A social services building occupies most of the block here, its entrance a revolving door that no longer revolves. The building helped people who needed help. The people still need help. The building can no longer provide it.

Flyers are posted on a bulletin board near the entrance. Shelter locations. Food bank hours. Hotline numbers. The information is outdated. The shelters are full or empty. The hotlines go unanswered.

A shopping cart sits abandoned near the entrance, filled with blankets and plastic bags and the careful accumulation of a life lived outdoors. The owner is gone. The cart remains, a still life of survival.`,
