  description: `Second Avenue crosses S. Main Street at an intersection that once saw steady traffic, cars and buses and delivery trucks. The traffic has stopped. The intersection remembers motion.

A bank occupies the corner, its marble facade projecting permanence and stability. The vault is locked. The money inside is worthless or valuable, depending on how you define both terms. The ATM screen is dark. The deposits have been discontinued.

A clock mounted on the bank's facade shows the correct time twice a day. The rest of the time it lies, its hands frozen at 3:47. Something happened at 3:47. Or the battery just died. Either explanation works.

The intersection is clear. Second Avenue runs north and south. S. Main continues east and west.`,
