  description: `The construction zone continues along the south side of the street, its black barriers revealing nothing. The north side shows what the zone replaced: older buildings, functional and unremarkable, the kind of structures that fill the gaps between landmarks.

A convenience store occupies one building, its windows covered with advertisements for lottery tickets and energy drinks and things that seemed important once. The door is locked. The lottery has been cancelled. The energy drinks are warm.

A bus shelter stands at the curb, its plastic walls covered with graffiti and its bench occupied by nobody. The buses stopped running. The shelter remains, sheltering nothing from nothing.`,
