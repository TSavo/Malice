  description: `Third Avenue is just ahead, its intersection marking the boundary between Pioneer Square proper and the office district beyond. The buildings grow taller to the east, their glass facades reflecting a sky that doesn't answer.

A check-cashing place occupies the corner, its neon signs listing services for people who didn't have bank accounts. Payday loans. Money orders. Wire transfers. The services exploited desperation. The desperation has evolved beyond exploitation.

Bars on the windows speak to a neighborhood that was never quite safe. The bars remain, protecting nothing from no one, a habit of caution that outlived its purpose.`,
