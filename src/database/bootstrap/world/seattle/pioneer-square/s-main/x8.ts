  description: `Third Avenue opens ahead, the intersection marking the eastern edge of the Corp Construction zone and the beginning of whatever lies beyond—taller buildings, the municipal towers of city government, the glass-and-steel commercial district that Seattle built when it decided to be a real city. The transition is visible in the skyline: Pioneer Square's four-story brick gives way to twenty-story concrete, the human scale yielding to the corporate.

CHECK INTO CASH occupies the corner building, a payday lender that served the customers the banks wouldn't serve. The window displays list services for the underbanked: PAYDAY LOANS UP TO $700 • MONEY ORDERS • WIRE TRANSFERS • CHECK CASHING NO BANK ACCOUNT NEEDED. The services extracted fees from desperation, charging 400% APR for the privilege of accessing your own future income. The business model was predatory. The predation has become moot. The fees still listed on the rate card assume an economy where fees can be extracted from something.

Bars cover the windows, iron grates bolted to the brick, security measures that spoke to a neighborhood where property needed protecting from people. The bars are rusted but intact. The glass behind them is unbroken. Whatever threat the bars were meant to deter has evolved beyond the ability of iron to stop it. The bars remain, a defensive gesture frozen in metal, protecting an empty space from nothing in particular.`,
