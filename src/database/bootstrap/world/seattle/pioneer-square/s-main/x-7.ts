  description: `FOSTER/WHITE GALLERY occupies the corner building, a white-walled space that dealt in Northwest art before Northwest art became a recognized category. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows: paintings still hung on their hooks, sculptures still positioned on their pedestals, the whole arrangement frozen in a moment of curatorial intention. A canvas near the window shows abstract shapes in red and black, the kind of work that required a gallery statement to interpret. The statement is filed somewhere. The interpretation has expired.

The gallery door is locked but transparent, giving the space the quality of a diorama—art in its natural habitat, preserved behind glass like the stuffed animals at natural history museums. A twisted metal sculpture stands in the center of the room, lit by skylights that still admit grey Seattle light. The sculpture's title card reads EMERGENCE. What's emerging is unclear. The emergence continues.

STORYVILLE COFFEE occupies the building across the street, an artisanal roaster that sourced beans from Ethiopia and Guatemala and places where the supply chains no longer reach. Through the window: a Probat roaster the size of a small car, its drum cold, its chaff collector full. Bags of green beans wait on shelves for roasting that will never happen. The smell that used to drift from this building—dark roast and caramelized sugar and the particular chemistry of coffee becoming coffee—is a memory now, replaced by the neutral scent of dust and stale air.`,
