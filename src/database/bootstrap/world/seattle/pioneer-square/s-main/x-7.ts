  description: `A gallery occupies the corner here, its windows displaying art that was avant-garde when it was hung and is simply present now. Abstract shapes and bold colors and statements that required explanation. The explanation is no longer available.

The gallery door is locked but the art is visible. A canvas of red and black that could be rage or could be roses. A sculpture of twisted metal that could be pain or could be just twisted metal. Art is patient. It can wait.

Across the street, a coffee roaster with bags of beans still stacked in the window. The beans are stale. The roaster is cold. The smell of fresh coffee is a memory.`,
