  description: `A jazz club occupied the basement here, its entrance a narrow stairway leading down from street level. A neon saxophone sign hangs above the stairs, dark now but intact. The music stopped months ago. The saxophone remains, frozen mid-note.

The stairs descend into darkness. The door at the bottom is closed. Whatever happened to the people inside, they're still inside, or they found another way out. Either way, the saxophone isn't talking.

Across the street, a tattoo parlor with flash art still covering the walls. Dragons and anchors and hearts with banners. The needles are still. The ink has dried. The art waits for skin that isn't coming.`,
