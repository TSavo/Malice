  description: `A small park occupies the southeast corner, a triangle of grass and benches where government workers used to eat lunch. The grass has grown wild, reclaiming the carefully planned space. Nature doesn't care about zoning.

A hot dog cart sits abandoned near the park entrance, its umbrella faded and its wheels flat. The vendor who worked this corner is gone. The cart remains, a monument to street food and entrepreneurship.

The smell of mustard and onions is long gone, replaced by the neutral smell of decay and patience. The city waits for something to happen. The city is patient.`,
