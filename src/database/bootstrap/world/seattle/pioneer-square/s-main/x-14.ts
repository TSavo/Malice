  description: `First Avenue and S. Main Street cross here at one of Pioneer Square's historic corners, the intersection where Seattle's original commercial district met its waterfront lifeline. The geometry is significant—Yesler Way angles northeast from here, Main Street runs due east, First Avenue heads north toward a blockage that didn't exist when this intersection was designed. The city planners who laid out these streets never imagined a scenario where the grid would stop mattering.

THE MERCHANT'S CAFE & SALOON occupies the southwest corner, a brick building with arched windows and a claim painted in gold leaf on the glass: "Seattle's Oldest Restaurant - Est. 1890." The claim may or may not be accurate—other establishments have contested it—but accuracy matters less than persistence. The Merchant's has persisted. The bar inside runs forty feet along the south wall, mahogany and brass, mirrors behind it that doubled the room's apparent size. The mirrors are dusty now. The doubling just creates more emptiness.

A streetlight leans at fifteen degrees from vertical, bent by some impact—a vehicle, probably, during the chaos, or maybe before, during the normal accidents of normal traffic. The light still works, its photocell still functioning, clicking on at dusk and off at dawn, illuminating pavement that no one walks. The lean gives the light a quality of inquiry, as if it's asking the intersection a question. The intersection doesn't answer.`,
