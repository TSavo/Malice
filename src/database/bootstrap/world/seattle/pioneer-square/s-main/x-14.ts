  description: `Main Street begins its climb here, rising from the waterfront toward Pioneer Square's elevated heart. Seattle was built on hills that the city tried to flatten, carting away millions of cubic yards of earth in regrading projects that lasted decades. Some hills they gave up on. This is one of them—a grade steep enough to make your calves burn if you're walking east, to make you grateful for gravity if you're walking west.

YE OLDE CURIOSITY SHOP has anchored this corner since 1899, a waterfront institution that blurred the line between museum and retail, selling shrunken heads and mummified mermaids alongside Space Needle shot glasses and rubber salmon. The window displays are still arranged—SYLVESTER, the famous mummy, still sits in his glass case, still holding his newspaper from 1895, still waiting for someone to pay the admission fee. He's waited longer than this before. The shop is locked. The curiosities remain curious.

A surface lot fills the north side of the block, asphalt faded to grey, white parking lines barely visible beneath grime and fallen leaves. One car sits in the corner space—a Hyundai Elantra, silver, driver's side window cracked, tire flat from months of sitting. A parking ticket is wedged under the wiper, yellowed and curling, citing violations that the city is no longer equipped to enforce. Someone parked here, paid the meter, walked away, and never came back. The meter has long since expired. The expiration means nothing now.`,
