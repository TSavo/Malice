  description: `The street climbs away from the waterfront, leaving behind the salt air and seagull cries. The buildings here are old, built when Seattle was young and ambitious and thought it could be a real city someday.

A souvenir shop occupies the ground floor, its windows full of Space Needle keychains and salmon-shaped everything. The tourists who bought these things are gone. The salmon remain, frozen in cheap plastic, swimming nowhere.

Across the street, a parking lot surrounded by chain-link fence. The lot is empty except for one car, a sedan with a flat tire and a parking ticket on the windshield. The ticket is dated three months ago. No one is coming to pay it.`,
