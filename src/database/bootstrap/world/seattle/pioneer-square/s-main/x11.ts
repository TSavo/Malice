  description: `The street passes between government buildings here, the courthouse on one side and administrative offices on the other. The architecture is brutalist, all concrete and right angles and surfaces that repel pigeons and humans equally.

A memorial plaque is mounted on one wall, commemorating something or someone that seemed important enough to cast in bronze. The plaque is still readable. The importance has faded.

A bicycle rack stands empty on the sidewalk, its metal loops designed for bikes that will never be locked there again. The commuters who biked to work are gone. The rack waits, optimistic and useless.`,
