  description: `Main Street passes through a canyon of government architecture here—the courthouse on one side, the King County Administration Building on the other, both structures built in the brutalist style that dominated civic construction in the 1960s. Concrete and right angles and minimal ornamentation, the aesthetic of institutions that wanted to project permanence and efficiency. The permanence remains. The institutions that occupied these buildings have gone wherever institutions go.

A bronze plaque is mounted at eye level on the administration building's facade, commemorating a county commissioner who served three terms and died in office. The plaque lists achievements that seemed significant at the time—infrastructure projects, budget reforms, the particular concerns of a particular era. The bronze has developed a green patina that fills the engraved letters, making them harder to read. The commissioner is remembered here, or would be, if anyone were reading.

A bicycle rack stands on the sidewalk, one of those wave-shaped installations that accommodate a dozen bikes locked at various points along the curve. The rack is empty. Government workers used to bike to work here, locking their commuter hybrids and folding bikes before entering the building to process permits and forms. The biking has stopped. The permits are unprocessed. The rack holds nothing, its curves an invitation that will not be accepted.`,
