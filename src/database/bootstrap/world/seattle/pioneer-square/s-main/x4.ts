  description: `The character of the street shifts here, leaving behind the tourist-friendly core of Pioneer Square and entering something more utilitarian. The buildings are newer, their facades less ornate, their purposes more practical.

A staffing agency occupies the ground floor, its window displaying job listings that are no longer being filled. Warehouse work. Office temps. Day labor. The labor market has collapsed. The listings remain, a museum of employment.

Across the street, a sandwich shop with a menu board listing combinations and prices. Turkey and Swiss. Ham and Cheddar. The bread is stale. The meat is gone. The combinations are theoretical.`,
