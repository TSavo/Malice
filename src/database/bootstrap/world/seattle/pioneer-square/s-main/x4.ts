  description: `The Corp barrier continues unbroken along the south side of Main Street, that endless wall of black fabric creating the unsettling sensation of walking beside a void—as if the city simply stopped existing on that side of the street and was replaced by something that doesn't want to be seen. The north side offers a reminder of what the construction displaced: two-story buildings from the 1950s, brick and concrete, the functional architecture of a city that needed space for businesses rather than statements.

7-ELEVEN occupies one of these buildings, a franchise that served the neighborhood's convenience needs—lottery tickets and energy drinks and microwave burritos and the small transactions of daily life. The windows are papered with promotional posters that promise SLURPEE SUMMER and BIG GULP DAYS, seasonal campaigns from a company that still exists somewhere, probably. The door is locked. The Big Gulps are flat. The lottery tickets wait for winners who will never come to scratch them.

A Metro bus shelter stands at the corner, its curved plexiglass walls tagged with graffiti in a dozen hands—names and symbols and the territorial markings of people who wanted to prove they existed here. The bench inside is empty. The route map shows lines that connected this corner to Capitol Hill, to the U District, to places that might as well be other continents. The buses stopped running when the drivers stopped coming. The shelter remains, its purpose reduced to providing slight protection from rain that falls on no commuters.`,
