  description: `First Avenue opens ahead, the intersection visible at the end of the block. This is the transition zone—waterfront giving way to Pioneer Square proper, tourist Seattle yielding to historic Seattle, though the distinction matters less now than it did when both parts were functioning. The architectural vocabulary shifts here: less maritime practicality, more urban aspiration. The buildings want to be taken seriously.

PIONEER PRINTING occupies the corner building, a family operation since 1956, specializing in the paper ephemera that documented milestones. Business cards for new ventures. Wedding invitations for hopeful couples. Funeral programs for departures. Birth announcements for arrivals. The window display shows samples of each, arranged in a timeline that tracks a hypothetical life from beginning to end. The Heidelberg press inside is silent, its rollers inked and ready for a job that will never run. The sample wedding invitation is for a date that passed six months ago. The sample funeral program belongs to someone who got their ceremony, at least.

A fire hydrant stands at the corner, painted Seattle yellow, the color mandated after the Great Fire when firefighters couldn't locate hydrants in smoke and chaos. The paint is fading now, peeling in places, revealing older layers beneath—red, then silver, then the original cast iron. The hydrant is an archaeological record of civic fire safety, each layer a policy decision, each decision someone's response to someone else's disaster. The newest layer is the oldest now. Nobody is adding more.`,
