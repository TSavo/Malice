  description: `A parking garage entrance yawns open on the south side of the street, its darkness absolute, its depths unknowable. A sign lists rates by the hour, the day, the month. Time has become irrelevant. The rates are academic.

The buildings on the north side are connected at the second floor by a pedestrian bridge, a skywalk that allowed office workers to move between buildings without touching the street. The workers are gone. The bridge remains, connecting nothing to nothing.

A newspaper box stands on the corner, its window displaying a front page from months ago. The headline announces something that seemed important then. The news has stopped. The box keeps its last story, a time capsule that no one asked for.`,
