  description: `A parking garage entrance opens on the south side of Main Street, its ramp descending into subterranean darkness. The garage serves—served—the office buildings above it, their workers driving in each morning and out each evening, the daily rhythm of commuter capitalism. The entrance gate is up, frozen in the position it held when the power went out or the attendant stopped attending. The darkness beyond is absolute. The depths are unknowable. A sign beside the entrance lists rates: $8/HR • $28/DAY • $180/MONTH. The economics that made those numbers meaningful have dissolved.

A pedestrian bridge spans Main Street overhead, connecting two office buildings at the second-floor level. The bridges were called "skyways" when they were fashionable in the 1970s, climate-controlled corridors that let office workers move between buildings without exposure to Seattle's weather. The workers who used this bridge carried coffee cups and manila folders and the concerns of their particular professional domains. The bridge is empty now, its glass walls clouded with condensation that no one wipes away. It connects nothing to nothing, a shortcut to nowhere.

A Seattle Times newspaper box stands at the corner, its window displaying a front page from months ago. The headline—something about interest rates, something about elections, something that seemed to matter—is yellowed and water-stained. The box accepted quarters for the privilege of reading yesterday's news. Yesterday has become indistinguishable from every other day. The news stopped. The box preserves its final edition like a fossil.`,
