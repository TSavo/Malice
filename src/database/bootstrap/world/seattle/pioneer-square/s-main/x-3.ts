  description: `The architectural temperature cools here as Main Street moves east—the ornate Romanesque facades of Pioneer Square's core giving way to simpler elevations, buildings that were built to function rather than impress. These are the back-office blocks, the spaces where insurance companies and wholesalers and other unglamorous businesses did unglamorous work. The glamour has drained from both ends of the spectrum now.

KENMORE CAMERA occupies a ground-floor retail space, one of those specialty shops that survived the smartphone era by serving photographers who cared about lenses and f-stops and the craft of making images. The window display is a museum of optical technology—DSLRs with prices still attached, mirrorless bodies, telephoto lenses that could resolve details at a thousand meters. The equipment represents thousands of hours of engineering and billions of dollars of R&D. The equipment sits behind glass, unused, its potential unactivated. Someone's wedding photos didn't get taken. Someone's portfolio didn't get built.

PACIFIC TRAVEL occupied the building across the street, a travel agency that specialized in corporate bookings and vacation packages to destinations that now feel theoretical. Posters in the window advertise Paris and Tokyo and Machu Picchu, the visual language of aspiration rendered in saturated color. The flights are cancelled. The destinations exist somewhere, presumably unchanged by whatever happened here. The distance between Seattle and everywhere else has become infinite.`,
