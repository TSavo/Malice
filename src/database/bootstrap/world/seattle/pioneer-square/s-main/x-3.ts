  description: `The center of Pioneer Square. The heart of old Seattle. The zero point from which the rest of the city measures itself, though no one is measuring anymore.

The Occidental Mall stretches north and south, a pedestrian corridor lined with maple trees and wrought-iron benches and the ghosts of better intentions. The cobblestones are uneven, the original street surface preserved for tourists who wanted to feel something historical beneath their feet.

A totem pole stands at the corner, carved by artists who were not from here, depicting figures from stories that were not Seattle's stories. The city stole it from Alaska in 1899 and called it heritage. The pole remains, silent witness to a theft that no longer matters.

The intersection is clear. Occidental runs north toward Yesler Way and south toward Jackson. S. Main continues east and west.`,
