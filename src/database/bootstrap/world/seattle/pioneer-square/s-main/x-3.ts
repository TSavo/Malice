  description: `This is the center of Pioneer Square, the geographic and historical heart of Seattle's original commercial district. Occidental Avenue crosses Main Street here at the zero point—the intersection from which early surveyors measured distances, the corner where the city began before the city knew what it was beginning. The significance has been commemorated on plaques that nobody reads. The significance persists regardless.

The Pioneer Square totem pole rises sixty feet from its concrete base at the intersection's northwest corner, carved cedar depicting Raven and other figures from Tlingit mythology. The city's businessmen stole the original from a Tlingit village in Alaska during an 1899 "goodwill expedition"—they literally sawed it down and loaded it onto a steamer. When the original burned in 1938, the city commissioned a replacement from the same Tlingit community and had the audacity to be surprised when they charged $5,000. The replacement stands here still, weathered to silver-grey, its story more complicated than the heritage plaques admit.

Occidental Mall stretches north and south, its cobblestones and maples and wrought-iron benches designed to evoke a pedestrian urbanism that Seattle never quite had. The design was an aspiration, not a restoration. The aspiration remains, even if the pedestrians don't. Maple branches interlock overhead. Benches wait for sitters who aren't coming. The zero point is silent now, measuring nothing from nothing.`,
