  description: `The cobblestones show through the asphalt here, patches of the original street surface exposed by wear and neglect. Seattle paved over its past but the past keeps pushing through, stubborn and uneven.

A used bookstore occupies the building on the north side, its shelves visible through a window that hasn't been cleaned in months. Thousands of books wait inside, their stories untold, their pages slowly yellowing. The owner locked up one day and never came back. The books don't mind. They're used to waiting.

A fire escape zigzags down the building across the street, its iron steps rusted orange. Someone has hung a plant from the lowest landing. The plant is dead, but it's still hanging there, committed to the aesthetic.`,
