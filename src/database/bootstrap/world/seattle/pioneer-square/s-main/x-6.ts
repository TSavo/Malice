  description: `East of Occidental, Main Street returns to vehicular scale—the cobblestones yield to asphalt, the pedestrian mall's careful curation gives way to the regular rhythm of storefronts and loading zones and fire hydrants. The transition is abrupt, like stepping from a museum back into the street. Both are equally empty now, but the street at least doesn't pretend otherwise.

ATLAS CLOTHING occupies the corner building, a vintage shop that dealt in the sartorial archaeology of previous generations. Through the window: mannequins dressed in styles that were already retro when they were purchased here—a flapper dress from the 1920s, a zoot suit from the 1940s, a powder-blue leisure suit from the 1970s. Each piece represented someone's fashion choice, someone's night out, someone's attempt to look like something they wanted to be. The mannequins model these aspirations with plastic composure, their poses unchanged since the last visual merchandising session.

A mural covers the entire west wall of the building opposite—a WPA-style scene of Seattle's working waterfront circa 1935, painted by an artist whose name appears in small letters at the bottom corner. Longshoremen and cranes and ships being loaded with timber and fish. The colors have faded to the soft palette of age, blues gone grey, reds gone brown. The waterfront depicted doesn't exist anymore. Neither does the workforce. The mural is a memorial to a memorial, history layered on history.`,
