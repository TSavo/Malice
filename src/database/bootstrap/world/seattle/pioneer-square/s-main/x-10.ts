  description: `THE NEW ORLEANS CREOLE RESTAURANT occupied the building here, but that's not what people came for. They came for the basement—DIMITRIOU'S JAZZ ALLEY, a venue that hosted touring acts and local musicians in a subterranean space where the acoustics were accidental and perfect. The entrance is a narrow stairway at street level, unmarked except for a neon saxophone sign that hangs above the stairs, its tubes cold, its blues silenced. The sign shows a stylized sax in profile, caught mid-note, frozen in a moment of music that will never finish.

The stairs descend into darkness. The door at the bottom is steel, windowless, designed to contain sound rather than light. Whether anyone is inside—whether anyone was inside when whatever happened happened—is unknown. The door doesn't offer information. The saxophone above keeps its counsel.

SLAVE TO THE NEEDLE occupies a storefront across the street, a tattoo parlor that specialized in custom work and charged accordingly. Flash art still covers the walls—traditional designs in the American style, eagles and roses and pin-up girls and hearts wrapped in banners bearing names that belonged to someone once. The needles are autoclave-sterile in their pouches. The ink has separated in its bottles, pigment settling to the bottom. The apprentice chairs sit empty. The art is patient. It waited years for the right skin to walk in. It can wait longer.`,
