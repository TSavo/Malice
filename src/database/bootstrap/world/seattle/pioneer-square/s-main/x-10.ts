  description: `First Avenue is just ahead, its intersection marking the eastern edge of the waterfront district. The buildings here straddle two worlds, maritime and urban, though both worlds have gone quiet now.

A print shop occupies the corner, its window displaying business cards and wedding invitations and funeral programs. The full cycle of life, rendered in cardstock. The printer is silent. The ink has dried.

A fire hydrant stands at the curb, painted yellow, its chains draped decoratively. The fire department painted all the hydrants after the Great Fire of 1889. They've been painting them ever since. No one is painting them now.`,
