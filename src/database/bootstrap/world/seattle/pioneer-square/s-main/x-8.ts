  description: `The heart of Pioneer Square begins here. The buildings are ornate, decorated with cornices and columns and details that cost money and meant something once. The Romanesque Revival style, the guidebooks called it. The guidebooks are out of print.

An antique shop occupies the ground floor, its window a museum of objects that outlived their owners. Pocket watches and porcelain dolls and furniture that survived the Great Fire. They will survive this too, probably.

A sandwich board stands on the sidewalk, its chalkboard listing daily specials that are no longer daily or special. The chalk has faded. The board remains, advertising nothing.`,
