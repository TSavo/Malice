  description: `This is where Pioneer Square stops apologizing for itself and starts announcing its intentions. The buildings here are the real thing—Romanesque Revival warehouses from the 1890s, designed by architects who had studied in Chicago and Paris and wanted Seattle to look like a city that mattered. The facades are heavy with ornament: arched windows bracketed by carved stone, cornices that project like shelves, columns of cast iron that carry loads they were engineered to carry. The style was called "commercial palace" at the time. The palaces have been abandoned.

ANTIQUES AT PIKE PLACE reads the sign over a ground-floor shop, despite being nowhere near Pike Place—the name borrowed from a more famous market for the cachet. The window is a taxonomy of survival: clocks that stopped telling time decades ago, china that outlived the tables it was set on, furniture that moved from house to house as estates dissolved. These objects have seen more history than the people who owned them. They'll see more yet, probably. Objects are patient.

A sandwich board lies face-down on the sidewalk, knocked over by wind or neglect or someone's hurried passage. The chalkboard face is pressed against concrete, whatever specials it advertised now speaking to an audience of asphalt. Someone will right it eventually. Or no one will. The specials have expired either way.`,
