  description: `Main Street runs through the center of Pioneer Square here, the buildings on either side representing the neighborhood at its most preserved. The storefronts were designated historic in the 1970s, protected by ordinances that mandated restoration rather than demolition. The ordinances succeeded—the buildings look much as they did in 1900. They just stand empty now.

A row of decorative streetlights lines the sidewalk, their ornate bases and glass globes designed to evoke the gaslight era. The lights were installed during the 1970s restoration, electric bulbs hidden in period-appropriate fixtures. The electricity is gone. The period-appropriate darkness has returned.

The Underground tours once started somewhere near here, guides leading tourists through the buried sidewalks of the pre-1889 city. The tours stopped when the tourists did. The underground remains, dark and silent beneath the streets.`,
