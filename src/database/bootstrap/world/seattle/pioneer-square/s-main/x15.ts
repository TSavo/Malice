  description: `Fourth Avenue and Main Street cross here at the gateway to the International District—the corner where Pioneer Square's Victorian brick gives way to Chinatown's particular blend of mid-century storefronts and cultural signifiers. The transition is marked by a traditional Chinese gate spanning the street to the east, red-painted timber with curved eaves and guardian lions, built in 2008 to announce WELCOME TO CHINATOWN-INTERNATIONAL DISTRICT in English and Chinese. The gate was always somewhat theatrical, a civic gesture toward authenticity. The theater continues. The audience is elsewhere.

The International District/Chinatown Station entrance descends into the earth at the corner, one of the Link Light Rail stops that connected this neighborhood to the airport and Capitol Hill and destinations that now feel impossibly distant. The escalators are frozen mid-step, their treads dusty, their handrails motionless. Below ground level: platforms where trains stopped every seven minutes during rush hour, tunnels that continue north toward Westlake and south toward the stadiums. The trains are down there somewhere, stopped wherever they stopped when the stopping happened. The platforms wait in darkness. The schedules posted on the walls are accurate only in the sense that they document a system that once existed.

This is where Main Street ends and the International District begins—different neighborhood, different history, different architecture, same silence. The paifang gate frames a view down the street, storefronts with signs in Chinese and Vietnamese, a heritage that outlasted the people who carried it. Pioneer Square is behind you now. Whatever's ahead is something else.`,
