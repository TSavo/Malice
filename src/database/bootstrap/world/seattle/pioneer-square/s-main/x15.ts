  description: `Fourth Avenue crosses S. Main Street at the eastern boundary of Pioneer Square. The International District begins here, its character distinct from the neighborhood behind. Different history. Different architecture. Different silence.

A pagoda-style gateway spans the street to the east, its red paint bright against the gray sky. The gateway was built for tourists, a promise of authenticity that was always somewhat manufactured. The tourists are gone. The gateway remains, welcoming no one.

A light rail station entrance descends into the earth nearby, its escalators frozen mid-step. The trains stopped running. The station waits underground, platforms empty, tunnels dark.

The intersection is clear. Fourth Avenue runs north and south. S. Main ends here at the edge of the International District.`,
