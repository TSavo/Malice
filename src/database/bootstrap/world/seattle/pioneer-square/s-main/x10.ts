  description: `The courthouse looms to the north, its concrete walls absorbing light and returning nothing. Government buildings are designed to intimidate. This one still does, even with no government inside.

A bail bonds office occupies the building across the street, its neon sign advertising freedom for a price. BAIL BONDS 24 HOURS. The hours have been discontinued. Freedom is no longer for sale, or perhaps it's finally free.

A flagpole stands in front of the courthouse, its rope slapping against the metal pole in the wind. The flag is gone, taken or stolen or simply blown away. The pole remains, saluting nothing.`,
