  description: `Third Avenue and Main Street cross here at the foot of the King County Courthouse, a concrete ziggurat that rises five stories above the intersection, its brutalist facade designed to project the weight of civic authority. The courthouse processed the county's criminal and civil matters—arraignments and sentencings and divorces and restraining orders, the legal infrastructure that kept society's conflicts contained within paperwork and procedure. The doors are bronze and massive. The authority they projected has dissolved along with everything else.

JUSTICE CENTER reads the lettering carved above the entrance, flanked by relief sculptures depicting the scales of law—balanced, impartial, the whole artistic language of fairness rendered in stone. The scales were always aspirational. The aspiration has become archaeology.

Parking meters line the curb in ranks, their mechanical faces showing TIME EXPIRED in faded red, their coin slots accepting nothing because there's nothing to accept. The meters were the front line of civic revenue collection, extracting quarters from citizens who wanted to park near the courthouse. The enforcement officers are gone. The meters remain at attention, collecting data from an experiment that has concluded. A few still have coins jammed in their slots, quarters that someone fed into the machine before the concept of paid parking became absurd.`,
