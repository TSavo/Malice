  description: `Third Avenue crosses S. Main Street at an intersection dominated by the King County Courthouse to the north. The courthouse is a fortress of concrete and civic authority, its steps leading up to doors that dispense justice to no one.

The scales of justice are carved above the entrance, balanced and impartial. The balance was always a lie, but it was a hopeful lie. Now it's just carved stone.

A parking meter stands at the corner, its face cracked, its slot jammed with quarters that will never be collected. The parking enforcement officers are gone. The meters remain, demanding payment for a service that isn't being provided.

The intersection is clear. Third Avenue runs north and south. S. Main continues east and west.`,
