  description: `Occidental Avenue opens ahead, the pedestrian mall that runs north through the heart of Pioneer Square. From here you can see the maple canopy, branches grown wild in the absence of trimming, creating a tunnel of green where sunshine used to filter through in carefully managed amounts. The urban forestry plan called for annual pruning. The plan has been indefinitely suspended.

THE CENTRAL SALOON occupies the corner building, a Seattle institution that has served drinks since 1892, making it one of the oldest continually operating bars in the city—or was, until operation ceased being continuous. The windows are papered with Seahawks schedules and Mariners posters and promotional materials for sporting events that happened or didn't. A hand-lettered sign announces GAME DAY SPECIALS. The games may have continued somewhere. The specials have expired here.

These buildings connect to Seattle's underground—the original street level that was buried after the Great Fire, when the city decided to raise itself above the tide flats rather than keep pumping out basements. The entrances are locked and alarmed and pointless, the tours that used to run through the underground suspended along with everything else. Below your feet: gas-lit storefronts from the 1880s, preserved in darkness, waiting for tourists who paid $20 to walk through history. The history is still there. The $20 is worth nothing.`,
