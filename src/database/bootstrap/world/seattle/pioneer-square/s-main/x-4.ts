  description: `Occidental Avenue is just ahead, its pedestrian mall visible at the end of the block. The maple trees that line the mall are overgrown now, their branches reaching across what was once a carefully planned urban space.

A sports bar occupies the corner, its windows papered with team schedules and promotional posters for games that were never played. The big screen inside is dark. The taps are dry. The jerseys on the wall commemorate seasons that have no endings.

The buildings here are connected by an underground passage, part of the old Seattle that was buried after the Great Fire. The entrances are locked. The tours stopped running. The underground waits, patient and dark.`,
