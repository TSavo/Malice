  description: `The brick-and-stone canyon deepens here, buildings rising four and five stories on both sides of Main Street, their facades heavy with the ornamental vocabulary of the 1890s—corbelled cornices, arched windows, cast-iron columns supporting weight that was meant to be permanent. This is post-fire Seattle, the city that rebuilt itself in masonry after the wooden one burned. They built to last. They got their wish, sort of.

THE ARCTIC BUILDING rises on the south side, its terra cotta facade decorated with twenty-seven walrus heads—actual sculptural walruses, tusks and all, jutting from the sixth floor. The building was headquarters for an Alaska mining company in 1917, the walruses a statement of arctic ambitions. The tusks were ivory originally, stolen by vandals in the 1940s, replaced with epoxy replicas that have weathered to the same grey-white. The walruses stare down at Main Street with expressions that haven't changed in a century. The street has changed. The walruses don't seem to notice.

JOHN'S BARBER SHOP occupies a narrow storefront across the street, its pole dark and still, the red-white-blue spiral frozen. Through the window: three chairs facing a mirror, each chair positioned at the same angle, chrome arms and leather cushions and the mechanical pumps that raise and lower the seats. Hair clippings still cover the floor beneath the center chair, swept toward the wall but never collected. The last haircut ended mid-sentence. The conversation continues in the dust.`,
