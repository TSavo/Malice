  description: `The buildings grow taller here, three and four stories of brick and stone. The architecture speaks of the 1890s, when Seattle rebuilt itself after the Great Fire and thought it had learned something about resilience.

A hotel occupies one building, its lobby visible through glass doors. The front desk is unmanned. The keys hang on their hooks. The rooms upstairs are empty, or not, depending on how brave you feel.

Across the street, a barbershop with a pole that no longer spins. The chairs inside face mirrors that reflect nothing but dust and abandonment. The barber is gone. The hair on the floor remains.`,
