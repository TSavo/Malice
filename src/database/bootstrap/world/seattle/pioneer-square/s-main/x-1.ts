  description: `Main Street approaches Second Avenue, the intersection that served as Pioneer Square's commercial center for over a century. The buildings here are the neighborhood's tallest and most ornate, their architects competing to impress the customers who once gathered at this crossroads. The competition is over. The buildings remain, monuments to ambitions that exceeded their context.

The sidewalks widen as the intersection approaches, the public space expanding to accommodate crowds that no longer gather. The extra width creates a plaza effect, the street itself becoming something like a square. The square is empty. The effect persists regardless.

Occidental Park is visible to the north, its dead trees standing sentinel over the open space. The park was the neighborhood's social heart—art walks, festivals, lunch crowds on sunny days. The heart stopped beating long ago. The body hasn't noticed yet.`,
