  description: `The buildings narrow here, squeezed into lots that were afterthoughts in the post-fire rebuilding. These are the buildings that filled gaps rather than claimed corners—ten feet wide, sometimes fifteen, their facades just broad enough for a door and a window and a sign. The architecture of economy, spaces carved from margins.

MARKET MAGIC & NOVELTY occupies one of these narrow storefronts, a magic shop that has served amateur prestidigitators since 1981. The window display is a taxonomy of wonder: decks of Bicycle cards with marked backs, coins that transform into different denominations, linking rings, cups and balls, silk scarves that change color when you know the secret. The secrets are all inside, filed in the proprietor's head and in the instruction booklets that came with each trick. The proprietor is gone. The secrets wait for practitioners.

PIONEER SHOE REPAIR shares the building, its entrance just to the left, its sign hand-painted on the transom window: HEELS WHILE U WAIT • SOLES • ZIPPERS • KEYS CUT. The cobbler's bench is visible through the window, surrounded by the tools of the trade—lasts and awls and stitching machines and the particular smell of leather and glue. Shoes line the shelves behind the bench, each pair tagged with a customer name and phone number, each pair waiting for pickup that isn't coming. The heels are repaired. The soles are renewed. The customers have walked their last miles.`,
