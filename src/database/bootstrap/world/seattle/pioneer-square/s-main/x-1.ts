  description: `The buildings here are narrower, squeezed between their neighbors like afterthoughts. Pioneer Square was rebuilt quickly after the Great Fire, and some of the rebuilding was more careful than other parts.

A magic shop occupies one of the narrow storefronts, its window displaying tricks and illusions and promises of wonder. Cards and coins and boxes with secret compartments. The magician who ran the shop is gone. The tricks remain, waiting for hands that know how to perform them.

Next door, a shoe repair shop with a sign that says "HEELS WHILE YOU WAIT." The wait is indefinite now. The heels sit on a shelf, orphaned from their owners, waiting for feet that will never return.`,
