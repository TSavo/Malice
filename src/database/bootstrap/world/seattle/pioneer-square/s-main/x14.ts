  description: `Fourth Avenue and Main Street cross here at what was once the gateway to the International District. The traditional Chinese gate that spanned the street lies collapsed across Main, red-painted timber shattered, curved eaves crushed flat, the guardian lions toppled and cracked. The gate fell during the chaos and no one has moved the debris. Main Street ends here in a wall of wreckage.

The International District/Chinatown Station entrance descends into the earth at the corner, one of the Link Light Rail stops that connected this neighborhood to the airport and Capitol Hill. The escalators are frozen mid-step, their treads dusty. Below ground level: platforms where trains stopped every seven minutes during rush hour, tunnels that continue into darkness. The trains are down there somewhere. The platforms wait in silence.

Beyond the fallen gate, you can see the International District's empty storefronts—signs in Chinese and Vietnamese, a heritage that outlasted the people who carried it. But there's no way through. The gate's collapse brought down part of the building behind it, creating an impassable barricade of brick and timber.

This is as far east as you can go on Main Street.`,
