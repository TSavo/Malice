// S. Main St - approaching 4th Ave

  description: `Fourth Avenue opens ahead, marking the official boundary between Pioneer Square and the International District—though the boundaries were always negotiated rather than fixed, Chinese grocers and Vietnamese restaurants bleeding west into Pioneer Square while galleries and coffee shops pushed east into Chinatown. The mixing happened at these margins. The margins are quiet now.

UWAJIMAYA sprawls across the south side of the block, an Asian supermarket that has served the community since 1928, when the Moriguchi family opened their first fish store in Tacoma. The current building is newer, a 60,000-square-foot complex with groceries and housewares and a food court. The windows display products that crossed the Pacific before the crossings stopped—Pocky and Meiji chocolate, rice crackers in foil packaging, instant noodles in flavors that never caught on in mainstream supermarkets. The inventory represents supply chains that spanned oceans. The oceans still exist. The chains don't.

A dragon statue guards the store entrance, ceramic scales painted in green and gold, whiskers bristling, pearl clutched in carved claws. The dragon is a guardian figure, meant to ward off evil spirits and attract prosperity. Its paint has faded in the sun that angles through this corridor. Its eyes are still watchful, still facing outward, still waiting for something worth guarding against. The dragon's patience is legendary. It can wait longer than this.`,
