  description: `The Waterfront meets S. Main Street at the edge of Pioneer Square. The elevated highway that once shadowed this corner is gone, torn down in a fit of urban renewal that happened just before urban anything stopped mattering.

The ferry terminal is visible to the west, its tower rising over Elliott Bay. The ferries stopped running months ago. The terminal remains, a cathedral to departures that will never happen.

A seafood restaurant occupies the corner, its neon crab sign dark and unlit. The tanks in the window are empty. The crab is gone. The smell of Old Bay seasoning lingers, a ghost of butter and garlic and better times.

The street rises east into Pioneer Square proper. The waterfront stretches north and south along the bay.`,
