  description: `Main Street climbs from the waterfront into Pioneer Square, the commercial artery that once connected the ferry terminal to the neighborhood's heart. The connection mattered when ferries brought commuters and tourists daily. The ferries stopped. The connection became theoretical.

The buildings here were built to serve waterfront commerce—shipping offices, customs brokers, the paper-pushers who kept cargo moving. Their ground floors had high ceilings and loading doors; their upper floors had windows facing the bay. The views are unchanged. The commerce they served is dust.

A brass plaque mounted on one building commemorates the 1889 fire that destroyed everything here, forcing the reconstruction that created Pioneer Square's current character. The fire is ancient history. The reconstruction is ancient history. The plaque tarnishes slowly, telling a story no one reads.`,
