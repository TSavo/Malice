  description: `The buildings press close together here, their upper floors almost touching, creating a canyon of brick and shadow. Fire escapes zigzag up the walls, rusted but intact.

A barbershop occupies a narrow space between larger buildings, its striped pole still and dark. The chairs inside are leather and chrome, the kind that adjust with a lever. Hair clippings still cover the floor, swept into piles that no one bothered to collect.

A calendar on the wall shows a month from before. The days are crossed off in red marker, counting down to something. The countdown stopped before it reached its destination.

Occidental Park is close now. The iron pergola is visible ahead.`,
