  description: `The park stretches away to the north and south here, a rectangle of dead trees and cracked cobblestones. The iron pergola is visible to the north, holding up nothing, its paint flaking away to reveal rust beneath.

This corner was busy once. Food carts and street musicians and office workers on lunch breaks. Now there is only silence and the wind moving through the dead branches.

A trash can stands at the corner, overflowing with debris that has composted into a solid mass. The city logo is still visible on the side. "SEATTLE - THE EMERALD CITY." The emeralds are gone. The city remains.

The buildings of Pioneer Square rise on all sides, their windows dark, their doors sealed.`,
