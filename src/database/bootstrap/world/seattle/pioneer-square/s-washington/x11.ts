  description: `The transition between neighborhoods is visible here. The brick of Pioneer Square gives way to the signs and storefronts of the International District. The languages change. The silence stays the same.

A Vietnamese restaurant occupies one building, its menu still posted in the window. Pho and banh mi and spring rolls. The kitchen is dark. The tables are empty. The food smells are gone, replaced by dust and decay.

Across the street, a social services office with bulletins and flyers still pinned to a cork board outside. Housing assistance. Food stamps. Job training. The services have been discontinued.

Fourth Avenue is close now.`,
