  description: `The architecture along this block reflects decades of development without coordination—a Victorian brick building beside a 1960s concrete box beside a glass-fronted structure from the 2000s. The result is the visual cacophony that characterizes urban edges, where neighborhoods overlap and no single aesthetic dominates. Each building follows its own logic, unified only by the street grid that contains them.

JADE GARDEN occupies the corner building, a dim sum restaurant that served the weekend crowds who lined up for carts of steamed dumplings and rice noodle rolls. The interior is visible through plate glass: round tables with lazy susans, the kitchen window where bamboo steamers once emerged in clouds of vapor, the red and gold color scheme that Cantonese restaurants favor. The space was designed for noise and bustle, for the controlled chaos of dim sum service.

Decorative wire spans the street overhead, the infrastructure for festival lighting that the International District Business Improvement Area maintained. The wire connects to buildings on both sides, creating a grid that supported paper lanterns during Lunar New Year and Moon Festival celebrations. The wire remains, though the lanterns are gone, a permanent framework awaiting decorations that may not come.`,
