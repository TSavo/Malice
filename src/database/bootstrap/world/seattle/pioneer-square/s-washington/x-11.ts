  description: `A bar occupied this corner once—MIKE'S WATERFRONT, according to the faded sign above the door, the kind of place that served longshoremen and sailors and anyone else who needed a drink before the sun was properly up. The neon signs are dark now but still mounted in the windows. "OPEN" promises one in cursive script. "COLD BEER" announces another. Both statements have become historical.

The windows are boarded from the inside, plywood visible through grimy glass, someone's response to something that required boarding. The door is steel with a small window at eye level, the kind of door that expects trouble. Graffiti covers the plywood and the brick beside it—tags and symbols and "RIP MIKE" in black marker, a memorial to whoever Mike was, written by whoever cared enough to write.

A fire escape climbs the building's north face, cast iron in the old style, its platform landings rusted but intact. The ladder is down, extended to within reach of the sidewalk, frozen in that position by corrosion or choice. First Avenue opens at the end of the block, the intersection visible through the grey air.`,
