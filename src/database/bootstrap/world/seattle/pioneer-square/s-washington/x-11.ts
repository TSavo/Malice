  description: `A bar occupied this corner once, the kind of place that served longshoremen and sailors and anyone else who needed a drink at seven in the morning. The neon signs are dark now, but they are still there. "OPEN" says one. "COLD BEER" says another. Both are lies.

The windows are boarded over from the inside. The door is locked. Someone has written "RIP MIKE" on the plywood in black marker. Mike was probably the owner. Mike is probably dead.

A fire escape clings to the side of the building, its ladder extended to the sidewalk. Someone used it to get up. Someone else used it to get down. The rust stains on the rungs could be anything.

First Avenue is close now.`,
