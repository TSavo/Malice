  description: `The buildings here are older, taller, built when this neighborhood was the center of everything. Red brick and sandstone, carved cornices and arched windows, the architectural vocabulary of a city that wanted to be taken seriously. They built to impress back then. They built to last. The impressiveness has outlived the impressing.

A jewelry store occupies the ground floor of one building, PACIFIC GOLD & GEMS according to the painted glass. The security gate has been torn from its tracks, bent metal hanging at an angle that suggests force rather than finesse. Through the shattered front window: empty display cases, glass scattered across the floor, the aftermath of decisions made when gold still seemed valuable.

The building opposite houses PIONEER SHOE REPAIR, a narrow storefront with a hand-painted sign promising "WHILE U WAIT." The wait has become indefinite. Through the window: walls of shelving, a cobbler's bench, the silent machinery of a trade that required feet to walk in the door. First Avenue is just ahead, the intersection opening at the end of the block.`,
