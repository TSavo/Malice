  description: `The street widens here where a building used to stand. The lot is empty now, filled with the rubble of whatever was demolished and never replaced. A chain link fence surrounds the property, but sections have been cut away or pulled down.

A portable toilet sits in one corner of the lot, bright blue plastic faded to grey. It has been here since the construction that never happened. No one has emptied it. No one ever will.

Across the street, a row of storefronts with apartments above. The storefronts are empty. The apartments might not be. Curtains move in one window, or maybe it is just the wind.

Smith Tower is visible ahead, white against the grey sky.`,
