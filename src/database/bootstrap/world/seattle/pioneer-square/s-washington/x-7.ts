  description: `A gym operated here once, the kind with exposed brick walls and motivational posters and the smell of sweat and ambition. The equipment is still inside, visible through the windows. Treadmills and weight racks and rowing machines, all of it coated in dust.

Someone kept coming here after. The dust on one treadmill is disturbed, footprints visible on the belt. They ran in place while the world ended around them. Maybe it helped. Maybe it did not.

Across the street, a law office with gold lettering on the window. "INJURIES - IMMIGRATION - DIVORCE." The holy trinity of human misfortune. The lawyers are gone. The misfortune remains.

The park is visible ahead, dead trees reaching over the rooftops.`,
