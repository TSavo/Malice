  description: `IRONWORKS FITNESS occupied this building, a gym that marketed itself to the creative class with exposed brick walls and Edison bulbs and memberships priced accordingly. Through the windows: rows of exercise equipment coated in dust, the treadmills and weight racks and rowing machines that defined a particular relationship with the body. The mirrors along the back wall reflect an empty room now, doubling the absence.

The building opposite houses a law office, its services painted in gold leaf on the window: INJURIES • IMMIGRATION • DIVORCE. The holy trinity of human misfortune, distilled into three words and a phone number. The office windows are dark. The lawyers are elsewhere. The misfortune they addressed has found new forms.

Occidental Park is visible ahead, the tops of maple trees rising above the roofline. The air here smells like old brick and something organic, the particular chemistry of cities returning to less organized states. The buildings on this block share a common facade line, their heights within a story of each other, Pioneer Square's building codes enforcing a uniformity that has become camouflage.`,
