  description: `This is the heart of the neighborhood, or close enough. The buildings rise on all sides, their brick facades stained dark by a century of rain and smoke. Somewhere beneath the street, the old city lies buried and forgotten.

A corner pub once served drinks here, the kind of place with brass fixtures and dark wood and the smell of hops and history. The brass is tarnished now. The wood is warped. The smell is something else entirely.

A plaque on the wall commemorates something historical. The words are worn smooth by time and weather. It probably explained why this corner mattered. It probably does not matter anymore.

The street continues east and west. The past is somewhere below. The future is uncertain.`,
