  description: `SECOND CHANCE THRIFT occupies the ground floor of a three-story building, its windows crowded with mannequins dressed in fashions from previous decades—polyester and shoulder pads and patterns that were ironic purchases when irony was affordable. The mannequins stare out at the street with blank eyes and frozen smiles, their poses suggesting occasions that no longer exist. They were unsettling before. Time has not improved them.

Through the glass: racks of clothing organized by color and type, the taxonomy of secondhand commerce preserved in its final arrangement. The store is locked but not looted. Clothing has little value when survival is the priority. The inventory waits, organized and useless, a museum of what people once chose to wear.

The building's upper floors hold apartments, their windows curtained or bare, their occupants either sealed inside or departed. The smell of mold drifts from somewhere—perhaps the building, perhaps the street, perhaps the accumulated dampness of a city that gets 150 days of rain a year. The smell has become part of Pioneer Square's atmosphere, unremarkable until you notice it.`,
