  description: `A thrift store takes up the ground floor here, its windows crowded with mannequins in outdated fashions. The mannequins stare out at the street with blank eyes and frozen smiles. They were creepy before. They are worse now.

The store is locked but not looted. Clothing has little value when survival is the priority. The racks inside are still full, organized by color and size, waiting for shoppers who will never browse again.

A donation bin sits outside, its chute jammed with bags that someone left and no one collected. The bags have split open, spilling clothes onto the sidewalk. Rain and sun have faded everything to the same grey.

The smell of mold drifts from somewhere nearby.`,
