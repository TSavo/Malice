  description: `S. Washington runs along the southern edge of Occidental Park here, the cobblestones giving way to asphalt where pedestrian mall meets vehicular street. The transition is marked by bollards—cast iron posts meant to prevent cars from entering the park proper. They still do their job, standing sentinel over traffic that no longer comes.

POUR DECISIONS occupies a corner space, its name spelled out in neon tubing that curves and loops in a font meant to suggest sophistication. The wine bar catered to the after-work crowd, the creative professionals who filled Pioneer Square's offices and needed somewhere to decompress before commuting home. The interior is visible through floor-to-ceiling windows: a long bar of reclaimed wood, industrial pendant lights, the carefully curated atmosphere of urban refinement.

The building opposite held a pottery studio, FIREHOUSE CLAY, its name a reference to the Great Fire that shaped Pioneer Square's architecture. Through the window: a row of potter's wheels, shelving units displaying student work in various stages of completion, the communal tables where people came to learn an ancient craft in a modern city.`,
