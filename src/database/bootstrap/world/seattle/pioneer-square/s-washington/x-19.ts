  description: `A warehouse dominates this block, a utilitarian structure of corrugated steel that has rusted to the color of dried blood. The building was constructed for function rather than beauty, its walls windowless except for a row of clerestories near the roofline, most of those panes now broken, letting rain and pigeons enter freely. The loading dock doors are sealed—welded shut or rusted into their frames, impossible to tell which without tools that nobody is applying.

PACIFIC RIM IMPORTS reads the faded logo painted on the warehouse's south wall, the text accompanied by a stylized ship that might be a container vessel or might be a clipper, the paint too weathered to distinguish. The company imported something—electronics or furniture or the endless stream of consumer goods that crossed the Pacific before the crossings stopped. Whatever inventory remains inside the warehouse remains inside, sealed behind doors that don't open, protected by walls that don't care about protection.

The street here smells like rust and rot, the particular chemistry of metal oxidizing and organic matter decomposing in the damp Seattle air. This was never a pretty block—industrial and utilitarian, built to move goods rather than impress visitors. The lack of pretension feels almost refreshing now. At least this block isn't pretending to be anything other than what it is.`,
