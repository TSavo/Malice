  description: `The park extends to the north here, but the street runs along its southern edge, lined with buildings that once held art galleries and boutiques and the kind of shops that sold handmade things for handsome prices.

A pottery studio occupies one storefront, its windows displaying vases and bowls and decorative pieces that no one will ever buy. The kiln inside is cold. The wheel is still. The clay has dried to dust.

Across the street, a wine bar with a clever name spelled out in neon. The neon is dark, but the name is still visible. "POUR DECISIONS." The decisions have been made. The pouring has stopped.

The Pioneer Building is visible ahead, red brick against the grey sky.`,
