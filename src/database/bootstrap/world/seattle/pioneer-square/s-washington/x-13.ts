  description: `A warehouse takes up most of the block here, its corrugated metal walls rusted orange, its windows set high and mostly broken. The loading bay doors are sealed shut, welded or rusted or both.

A faded logo on the side of the building shows a ship and the words "PACIFIC RIM IMPORTS." Whatever they imported, it is still in there, or it was taken long ago. The doors do not open to answer the question.

A dumpster sits at the curb, overflowing with debris that has been rained on and dried and rained on again until it forms a solid mass. Something is living in there. Rats, probably. There are always rats.

The street continues east toward the old neighborhood.`,
