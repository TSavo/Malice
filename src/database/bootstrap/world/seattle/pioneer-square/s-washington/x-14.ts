  description: `Washington Street crosses First Avenue at one of Pioneer Square's well-preserved intersections, the brick buildings on all four corners maintaining the Victorian character that once defined the neighborhood. The Grand Central Building's northern face dominates the southeast corner, its ornate facade a reminder of the ambitions that built this place.

First Avenue runs north toward the debris pile that blocks access to downtown, the collapsed building visible from here as a wall of rubble across the intersection with Yesler. The blockage has defined the neighborhood's boundaries for decades now, the only exit to downtown being through the waterfront gap to the west.

The intersection feels like a crossroads in the older sense—a place where paths meet, where decisions are made about which direction to take. The decisions are simpler now. The paths lead to fewer places.`,
