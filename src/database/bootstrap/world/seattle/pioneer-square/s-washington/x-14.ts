  description: `The street rises here from the waterfront, leaving behind the smell of salt and decay. The buildings on either side are old, their brick facades stained dark by decades of rain and neglect.

A maritime supply store occupies the ground floor, its windows clouded with grime. Rope and anchors and navigation equipment are visible inside, tools for ships that will never sail again. A sign offers "FRESH BAIT" in hand-painted letters. The bait is no longer fresh.

Across the street, a loading dock stands empty, its roll-up door bent and rusted. Pallets are stacked against the wall, slowly rotting into the concrete.

The waterfront is downhill. The neighborhood continues uphill.`,
