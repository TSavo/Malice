  description: `The Corp Construction zone ends here, its black fabric barriers giving way to older buildings that survived whatever was happening inside. The fence line is clear, a boundary between secrecy and ruin.

A diner occupied the corner once, the kind with chrome stools and formica counters and coffee that was always hot and always bad. The stools are still there, lined up at the counter, their vinyl seats cracked and faded. The coffee pots are empty. The pie case is dark.

A handwritten sign in the window says "OPEN 24 HOURS." The hours have been cancelled. The sign remains, a promise that cannot be kept.

The street continues east toward 4th Avenue and the International District beyond.`,
