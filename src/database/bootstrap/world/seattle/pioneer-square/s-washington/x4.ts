  description: `The character of the street changes here. The historic brick gives way to cheaper construction, buildings thrown up in the seventies when no one cared about aesthetics. Function over form. Profit over pride.

A check cashing place occupies the corner, its neon signs dark, its bulletproof glass still intact. The glass was meant to keep the money safe. The money is worthless now, but the glass remains, protecting nothing from no one.

Across the street, a vacant lot filled with the debris of demolition. Concrete chunks and twisted rebar and the bones of a building that was torn down and never replaced. A sign on the fence announces future development. The future never arrived.

The Collapsed Building is closer now. The rubble is visible ahead.`,
