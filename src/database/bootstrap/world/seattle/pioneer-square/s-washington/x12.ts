  description: `A parking garage dominates the block here, five levels of concrete painted a color that was probably beige once. The entrance ramp descends into darkness. A sign lists rates that seem quaint now. All day parking for fifteen dollars. The days are free now. So is everything else.

The garage is mostly empty, visible through the open sides. A few cars remain on the upper levels, abandoned by owners who left and never returned. A pickup truck on the third level has a mattress in the bed. Someone was living there for a while.

Across the street, a row of storefronts with signs in Chinese and English. Import stores and herbalists and places that sold things tourists wanted. The tourists are gone. The things remain.`,
