  description: `A parking structure dominates the block, five levels of poured concrete rising above the streetscape. The design is pure function—helical ramps, open sides for ventilation, the minimum structure required to stack automobiles. The beige paint that once softened the brutalist aesthetic has weathered to grey, stained darker where water runs down the facade during Seattle's frequent rains.

The garage served the workers and visitors who filled this transitional zone between Pioneer Square and the International District. The rate sign near the entrance lists prices in the incremental structure that parking garages favored: first hour, additional hours, daily maximum. The structure's open sides reveal the interior—ramps spiraling upward, fluorescent fixtures mounted to concrete ceilings, the painted lines that organized space into monetizable rectangles.

The storefronts across the street reflect the International District's retail character: import shops with signage in Chinese and English, herbalists with window displays of dried goods in glass jars, the specialty stores that served both the local community and tourists seeking authenticity. GREEN LEAF HERBS occupies the corner, its window lined with the ceramic containers and wooden drawers of traditional Chinese medicine.`,
