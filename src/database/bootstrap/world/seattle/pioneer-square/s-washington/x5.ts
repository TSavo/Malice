// S. Washington St - approaching 3rd Ave

  name: 'S. Washington St',
  description: `The debris field narrows the street to a single lane here, the rubble from the Collapsed Building forming a wall along the north side. The pile has settled over time, rain and gravity compacting the loose material into something more stable. Weeds have begun colonizing the edges—dandelions and grass, the pioneer species that establish in disturbed ground.

The buildings along the south side of the street survived, their proximity to the collapse evident in cracked windows and facades streaked with brick dust. A parking structure occupies most of the block, its concrete ramps spiraling upward to levels that held cars for the office workers who once populated this area. The structure's design dates it to the 1970s—poured concrete, minimal ornamentation, the brutalist aesthetic that municipal architecture favored.

The intersection with 3rd Avenue opens ahead, the cross-street providing a route around the debris field. The Corp Construction site's perimeter fencing is visible to the south, black fabric screening whatever lies within from casual observation.`,
