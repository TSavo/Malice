  description: `This stretch of Washington was always the back-of-house, the service corridor that kept Pioneer Square's storefronts supplied. Loading docks line the south side of the street, their roll-up doors sized for delivery trucks, their concrete aprons stained with decades of diesel and hydraulic fluid. The buildings here show their utility infrastructure—electrical conduit, ventilation ducts, the mechanical systems that retail facades conceal.

A mid-century warehouse dominates the block, its corrugated metal siding rusted to various shades of orange and brown. The building housed a restaurant supply company, SEATTLE FOODSERVICE EQUIPMENT according to faded lettering on the loading bay. The restaurant industry required a constant flow of replacement parts—fryer baskets, steam table pans, the specialized tools that commercial kitchens destroy through use.

Power lines cross overhead, the utility poles leaning slightly from decades of accumulated strain. A street tree—some variety of ornamental pear, planted when the city still maintained such things—has grown into the wires, its branches intertwined with the cables in a way that would have concerned the power company.`,
