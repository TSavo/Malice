  description: `The street runs between the Pioneer Building and what remains of the block to the east. This stretch was never the prettiest part of the neighborhood. Service entrances and loading docks, dumpsters and utility poles, the parts of the city that worked so the pretty parts could pretend to be pretty.

A loading dock gapes open on the south side, its metal door hanging at an angle. Inside, darkness and the smell of things that have been wet too long. Wooden pallets are stacked against one wall, warped and splitting. Whatever was delivered here was delivered a long time ago.

Power lines sag overhead, some of them down, some of them tangled in the dead branches of a street tree. The tree was probably an oak. It is hard to tell now. It is hard to tell a lot of things now.

The rubble of the Collapsed Building is visible ahead, blocking the street. There is no going that way. Not anymore.`,
