  description: `The Pioneer Building's retail arcade continues here, a covered walkway that runs along the ground floor, its arched openings framing storefronts that changed tenants regularly but never purpose. The arcade was designed to shelter pedestrians from Seattle's rain, a practical feature that became architectural signature. Similar arcades appear throughout Pioneer Square, the covered sidewalks connecting buildings into a coherent urban fabric.

PIONEER ANTIQUES occupies a double-wide storefront, its display windows crammed with furniture arranged in the maximalist style that antique stores favor—every surface covered, every corner filled, the accumulated inventory of estate sales and consignment and the things people couldn't take with them. A grandfather clock stands near the window, its case dark walnut, its brass pendulum frozen mid-swing.

The buildings along this stretch maintain consistent cornice lines, their facades varying in detail but unified in scale. Pioneer Square's building codes enforced this uniformity after the Great Fire, ensuring that the rebuilt neighborhood would present a coherent streetscape. The codes worked. The streetscape endures.`,
