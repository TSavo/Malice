  description: `The Pioneer Building continues along the north side of the street here, its retail spaces empty, its upper floors dark. The building has good bones, as they used to say. The bones are all that remain.

An antique store occupies a narrow space, its window crammed with furniture and lamps and the accumulated debris of other people's lives. A sign says "ESTATE SALES OUR SPECIALTY." Every sale is an estate sale now. Everyone has an estate.

A grandfather clock is visible through the window, its pendulum still, its hands stopped at 3:47. That was probably when the power went out. That was probably when a lot of things stopped.

The intersection with 2nd Avenue is ahead.`,
