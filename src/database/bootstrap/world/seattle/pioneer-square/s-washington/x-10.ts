  description: `The buildings here are older, taller, built when this neighborhood was the center of everything. Red brick and sandstone, carved cornices and arched windows. They built to impress back then. They built to last.

A jewelry store occupies the ground floor, its display cases empty, its security gate torn from its tracks. The cases themselves are smashed, the glass scattered across the floor like ice. Whatever was inside is long gone. Probably traded for food. Probably worthless now anyway.

Across the street, a shoe repair shop with a hand-painted sign. "WHILE U WAIT" it promises. The wait has been long. The shoes are still there, tagged and organized on shelves, waiting for customers who will never return.

The intersection with 1st Avenue is just ahead.`,
