  description: `Third Avenue crosses Washington here, but Washington does not continue much further. The Collapsed Building has seen to that. The entire east side of the intersection is blocked by debris, a mountain of rubble that used to be architecture.

The building fell toward the street when it went, pancaking floor by floor, each one driving the next one down. The physics of collapse are simple. The results are not. Somewhere in that pile are desks and computers and coffee mugs and photographs and all the other things that make an office an office. Somewhere in there are the people who worked at those desks.

A fire hydrant stands at the corner, knocked askew by falling debris but still intact. The red paint is chipped and faded. Water pressure is a memory. If something catches fire now, it burns until it stops burning.

Third Avenue runs north and south, threading between the ruins. The Corp Construction zone is visible to the south, its fences and barriers still standing, still protecting whatever they were building in there.`,
