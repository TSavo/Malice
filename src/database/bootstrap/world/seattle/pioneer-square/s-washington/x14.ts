  description: `Fourth Avenue marks the formal eastern boundary of Pioneer Square, the intersection creating a corner that belongs to both neighborhoods and neither. The International District's signage dominates the buildings to the east, while the Collapsed Building's debris field spreads westward, a physical barrier more absolute than any administrative boundary.

From this angle, the collapse reveals its interior—the cross-section of a building's private spaces exposed to weather and observation. Floor plates are visible in the debris pile's stratigraphy, each level distinguishable by the layer of rubble it contributed. Pipes and conduit dangle from broken walls. A section of interior wall remains partially intact, its wallpaper—a geometric pattern in muted greens—still adhered to plaster that has nowhere to fall.

The buildings at this intersection survived, their proximity to the collapse evident in cracked windows and facades streaked with the particular grey of concrete dust. UWAJIMAYA VILLAGE is visible to the south, the Asian grocery and retail complex that anchors the International District's commercial core. The wing nut sculpture at the intersection—a piece of public art that predates the Event—stands undamaged, its abstract bronze forms indifferent to the destruction nearby.`,
