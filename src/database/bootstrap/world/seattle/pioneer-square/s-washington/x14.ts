  description: `The boundary between neighborhoods is arbitrary here, a line on a map that meant something to someone once. Pioneer Square ends. The International District begins. The rubble does not notice the difference.

A tea shop occupies the ground floor, its window displaying ceramic pots and bamboo implements and the tools of a ceremony that required patience and precision. The tea is gone. The ceremony is over. The pots remain, dusty and useless and somehow beautiful.

Across the street, a community center with flyers still posted on the door. ESL classes and citizenship prep and cultural events. The classes have been cancelled. The culture persists, stubborn and silent and waiting.

Fourth Avenue is ahead. The Collapsed Building's debris is visible to the north, a wall of rubble that blocks any easy passage.`,
