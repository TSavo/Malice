  description: `The formal boundary between Pioneer Square and the International District lies somewhere along this block, though the transition has been gradual enough that the line feels arbitrary. City planning documents specify 4th Avenue as the demarcation, but the International District's influence extends westward, its signage and storefronts bleeding into Pioneer Square's historic district.

PHOENIX TEA occupies a ground-floor space, its window displaying the implements of gongfu tea ceremony—yixing clay pots, porcelain cups without handles, the wooden tea trays with drainage systems. The shop served both practitioners who understood the ritual and curious visitors who wanted to learn. The interior is arranged for demonstration: a long table where the owner conducted tastings, shelving lined with canisters of loose-leaf varieties, the aesthetic minimalism that tea culture requires.

The CHINESE COMMUNITY CENTER anchors the opposite corner, a two-story building that housed language classes, cultural programs, and the social services that immigrant communities need. The center was built in the 1970s, its architecture reflecting the era—flat roof, minimal ornamentation, the institutional aesthetic of nonprofit budgets. A glass-fronted bulletin board beside the entrance once held community announcements, its cork backing still visible behind clouded glass.`,
