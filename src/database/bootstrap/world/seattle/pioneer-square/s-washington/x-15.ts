  description: `Washington Street runs up from the waterfront into Pioneer Square, the grade gentler here than on the parallel streets to the south. The easier climb made this corridor attractive for foot traffic in the early days, before motor vehicles flattened the distinction between grades. The distinction has returned, now that feet are all that matter.

The ferry terminal's bulk is visible to the west, its steel framework still standing though no ferries have docked in decades. Washington Street once carried commuters from ferry to office, a daily tide of workers flowing uphill in the morning and down in the evening. The tide stopped. The channel remains.

A seawall overlook interrupts the streetscape, a small plaza with benches facing the bay. The overlook was built in the 2010s, part of the waterfront improvement project that was supposed to reconnect the city to its shoreline. The reconnection happened just in time for there to be no one left to enjoy it.`,
