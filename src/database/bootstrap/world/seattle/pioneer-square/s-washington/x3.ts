  description: `The Pioneer Building occupies the entire block here, six stories of red brick and Romanesque arches. They built it in 1892, right after the Great Fire, when the city was still smoking and everyone was convinced Seattle would rise from the ashes greater than before. They were half right.

The ground floor windows are boarded over with plywood that has weathered grey. Someone painted "OPEN FOR BUSINESS" on one of the boards. The joke was funnier before.

A cornerstone near the entrance is carved with the building's name and date. Below it, someone has scratched initials and a heart, the way people used to mark their presence. J + M, 1994. They were probably tourists. They probably thought they would come back someday.

Second Avenue stretches north and south, empty in both directions. The Collapsed Building is visible to the east, a heap of rubble that used to be something else.`,
