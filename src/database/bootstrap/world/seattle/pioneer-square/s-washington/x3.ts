  description: `The Pioneer Building anchors this intersection, its northwestern corner marked by the original entrance—a triple-arched portal of carved sandstone that architects called Richardsonian Romanesque. Henry Hobson Richardson never designed buildings in Seattle, but his style traveled west on railroad and telegram, influencing the post-fire reconstruction. The arches have the solid weight that Richardson favored, the stone rough-cut to suggest permanence.

A cornerstone near the entrance bears the building's credentials: PIONEER BUILDING • 1892 • ELMER FISHER, ARCHITECT. Fisher designed a third of Pioneer Square's post-fire buildings, establishing the neighborhood's visual vocabulary. His name appears on cornerstones throughout the district, a signature repeated across blocks.

Second Avenue stretches north and south from here, the cross-axis that connects Pioneer Square to the International District and points beyond. The Collapsed Building is visible to the east, its rubble pile a sharp contrast to the Pioneer Building's endurance—same era, same construction methods, different outcomes.`,
