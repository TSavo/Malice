  description: `A travel agency occupies the corner here, its windows plastered with posters of destinations that seem impossibly far away now. Beaches and mountains and cities with lights that still work. "ESCAPE TO PARADISE" one poster says. The escape route has been closed.

Inside, the desks are arranged in neat rows, each one with a computer and a phone and a nameplate. The computers are dark. The phones are silent. The nameplates identify people who sold dreams for a living. The dreams are no longer for sale.

A globe sits on one desk, the kind that lights up when you plug it in. It is not plugged in. It shows a world that no longer exists, with borders that no longer matter.

The park opens up to the east.`,
