  description: `Smith Tower looms here, its white terra cotta facade rising thirty-eight stories into the grey sky. The building tapers as it climbs, an architectural style they called "wedding cake" back when people still had weddings. The pyramid at the top is barely visible through the haze.

The main entrance faces the street, bronze doors green with age, chained shut with locks that have rusted into a single mass of metal. A brass plaque beside the doors lists the building's history: 1914, tallest building west of the Mississippi. The plaque does not mention what happened after.

The lobby is visible through grimy windows. Marble floors, ornate elevator doors, a security desk with no one behind it. The famous Chinese Room is up there somewhere, on the 35th floor, with its hand-carved furniture and its wishing chair where brides once sat. The elevator does not run anymore. The brides are gone.

1st Avenue runs north and south. Washington runs east toward what is left of the neighborhood.`,
