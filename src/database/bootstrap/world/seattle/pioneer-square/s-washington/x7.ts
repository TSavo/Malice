// S. Washington St - approaching 3rd Ave

  description: `Third Avenue is close now, the intersection visible ahead. But the Collapsed Building has changed the geography here. Rubble spills into the street from the east, chunks of concrete and tangles of rebar and the detritus of what was once a seven-story office building.

Nobody knows exactly what happened. The building stood for eighty years, survived earthquakes and neglect and the slow rot of deferred maintenance. Then one day it did not stand anymore. Some say it was the shaking. Some say it was the blast wave. Some say it was just time, catching up all at once.

A shoe lies in the rubble near the street. Just one shoe, a woman's flat, grey with dust. The other shoe is somewhere in there. So is everything else.

Caution tape flutters from a bent signpost, yellow and black, the universal language of do not enter. The tape has been here long enough to fade. No one is coming to clean this up.`,
