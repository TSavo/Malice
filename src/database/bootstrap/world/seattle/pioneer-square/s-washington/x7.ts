  description: `The Collapsed Building's debris field begins here, the rubble spilling westward from what was once a seven-story office building. The structure dated to 1923, unreinforced masonry construction of the type that seismic engineers call "soft story"—ground floor retail with open spans, upper floors heavy with brick and concrete, the whole assembly balanced on columns that work fine until they don't.

The collapse pattern suggests pancaking, each floor driving the one below it down in sequence. The debris pile preserves a rough stratigraphy—basement at the bottom, penthouse at the top, everything in between compressed into a layer cake of destruction. Rebar protrudes from concrete chunks at angles that suggest the violence of the failure. Brick dust has settled over everything, giving the rubble a uniform reddish hue.

Third Avenue is visible ahead, the intersection threading between the debris field and the buildings that remained standing. The Corp Construction zone's fencing begins just south of here, its black fabric barriers concealing whatever development was underway when construction stopped.`,
