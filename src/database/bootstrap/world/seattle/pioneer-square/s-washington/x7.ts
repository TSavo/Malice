  description: `Third Avenue intersects Washington here at a dead end in both directions. The collapsed building's rubble has completely buried Third Avenue north toward Yesler AND Washington Street east toward 4th Avenue—a mountain of brick, concrete, and twisted steel two stories high blocking all passage. This intersection is as far east and north as you can go on this side of Pioneer Square.

To reach 4th Avenue or Yesler Way, you'll have to backtrack west and find another route entirely. The collapse took out everything northeast of here.

The northwest corner holds a building that survived, its brick facade cracked but intact. PACIFIC NORTHWEST TITLE COMPANY occupies the ground floor, the name etched in the glass transom above the entrance. A fire hydrant marks the corner, its red paint weathered to rust, knocked off true by debris that scattered when the building came down. West on Washington and south on Third remain passable.`,
