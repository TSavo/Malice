  description: `Washington Street approaches Fourth Avenue at the edge of the collapsed building zone, the rubble pile visible to the north where the structure fell and was never cleared. The collapse created a barrier that forced the street's effective end, traffic routing around rather than through.

The buildings on this block show the damage from the collapse—windows shattered by the shockwave of falling masonry, facades pocked with impact marks from flying debris. The damage was never repaired, never even assessed. The buildings stand wounded, their injuries on display.

The International District's influence is strong here, the signage becoming predominantly Asian, the architectural style shifting toward the practical buildings that characterized the neighborhood. The transition feels abrupt on this block, the collapsed building having created an artificial boundary between districts.`,
