// S. Washington St - approaching 4th Ave

  name: 'S. Washington St',
  description: `The last block before 4th Avenue. The buildings here are a mix of old and new, brick beside glass beside concrete. The architects called it eclectic. The residents called it a mess. Now it is all the same. Ruins do not have styles.

A dim sum restaurant occupies the corner, its rolling carts still visible through the window, its bamboo steamers stacked on shelves. The carts are empty. The steamers are dry. The recipes are lost.

Red lanterns hang from a wire strung across the street, their silk faded and torn. They were put up for a festival that never ended properly. They swing in the wind now, tattered and forgotten, celebrating nothing.

Fourth Avenue is just ahead. The International District begins beyond it.`,
