  description: `The Pioneer Building looms to the north here, six stories of red brick and arched windows. It has stood since 1892, when the city was still smoldering from the Great Fire. It will probably stand for another century, outlasting everything except the stones it was built on.

A florist shop occupies the ground floor of a smaller building, its refrigerated cases dark, its flowers long dead. The smell of decay drifts through the broken door. Roses and lilies and carnations, rotting into compost. Someone was supposed to pick up an order. The order is still waiting.

A sandwich board on the sidewalk advertises bouquets for every occasion. "SAY IT WITH FLOWERS." There is nothing left to say.

Second Avenue is close now.`,
