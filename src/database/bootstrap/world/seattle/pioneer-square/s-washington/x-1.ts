  description: `The Pioneer Building dominates the northern view, its six stories of red brick and Romanesque arches establishing the architectural vocabulary that defines Pioneer Square. Elmer Fisher designed it in 1892, part of the building boom that followed the Great Fire—fifty blocks of wooden structures replaced with brick and stone and terra cotta, the city literally fireproofing itself against repetition.

SEATTLE FLOWER MARKET occupies the ground floor of the adjacent building, a narrow storefront with a green awning that has faded to something closer to grey. The refrigerated display cases line the front window, their glass fogged with condensation that dried into mineral deposits. Florists depended on occasions—weddings, funerals, anniversaries, the calendar of human milestones that required botanical punctuation.

The street narrows slightly here as older buildings crowd closer to the sidewalk, their facades predating modern setback requirements. Fire escapes zigzag up the eastern walls, the iron platforms and ladders that building codes mandated after the lessons of 1889.`,
