  description: `Washington Street approaches Second Avenue, passing along the northern edge of Occidental Park. The park's brick paving extends right up to the street edge, the boundary between thoroughfare and plaza marked only by a subtle change in brick pattern. The distinction was intentional—park and street meant to flow together, public space expanding to fill whatever area people chose to occupy.

The Corp Construction barrier is visible to the east, its black fabric wall cutting across the view where the street would continue toward Third Avenue. The barrier blocks more than passage—it blocks sight, hiding whatever activity occurs behind it. The mystery of the hidden construction has become part of the neighborhood's character.

A row of young trees was planted along this block in the 1990s, intended to soften the urban landscape. The trees grew, then stopped growing, then died. Their bare branches reach toward each other across the street, forming an arch of dead wood.`,
