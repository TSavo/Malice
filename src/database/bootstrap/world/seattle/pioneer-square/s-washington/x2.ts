  description: `The street opens up here as it approaches the intersection. The buildings pull back, creating a plaza of sorts, paved with bricks that have heaved and cracked over the decades.

A coffee cart sits at the curb, its awning torn, its espresso machine rusted solid. The menu board is still readable. Americano. Latte. Mocha. The prices are listed in dollars. The dollars are worthless. The coffee is gone.

A newspaper box stands nearby, its coin slot jammed, its window displaying a headline from before. Something about politics. Something about the economy. Something that seemed important at the time.

Second Avenue crosses just ahead. The Collapsed Building is visible to the east.`,
