  description: `The street widens as it approaches 2nd Avenue, the buildings stepping back to create a broader public space at the intersection. The pavement here is brick rather than asphalt, the herringbone pattern that Seattle used for pedestrian-priority areas. The bricks have heaved and settled over the decades, frost and tree roots and the general subsidence of fill undermining the careful geometry.

The building on the south corner housed a succession of restaurants, the ground floor configured with the large windows and open kitchen that modern dining demanded. BRACKET occupies the space now—or occupied it—a farm-to-table concept that sourced ingredients from Puget Sound farms and served them to tech workers who appreciated the provenance. The Edison bulbs and reclaimed wood aesthetic is visible through windows that need cleaning.

Ahead, the intersection with 2nd Avenue marks a transition. East of here, the Collapsed Building's debris field interrupts the streetscape, a reminder that even Pioneer Square's sturdy brick construction has limits.`,
