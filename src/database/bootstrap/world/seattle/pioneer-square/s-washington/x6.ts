  description: `Washington Street runs along the northern edge of the Corp Construction site here, the black barrier wall dominating the southern view. The barrier extends the entire length of the block, unbroken, unmarked except for small corporate logos at regular intervals. Whatever Continuum or their contractors are building, they're doing it without explanation.

The northern side of the street offers a view of open lots where buildings were demolished before the end—urban renewal that never got around to the renewal part. The lots are overgrown now, small forests reclaiming the cleared ground, saplings growing where foundations were dug and never filled.

The contrast is stark: corporate activity on one side, abandonment on the other. Washington Street has become a boundary between two kinds of emptiness—the managed emptiness of construction and the organic emptiness of decay.`,
