  description: `A narrow building wedges itself between larger neighbors here, three stories of dirty brick with fire escapes clinging to the facade like metal vines. The windows are intact but dark. A faded sign above the ground floor reads "BAIL BONDS - 24 HOURS" in letters that were probably red once.

The bail bondsman kept interesting hours. His clients kept interesting company. Neither of them are keeping anything anymore.

A payphone booth stands on the corner, its glass panels shattered, the phone itself hanging by its cord. The dial tone died years ago, but someone has taped a handwritten note inside the booth. The note is illegible, weathered to a brown smear. It probably was not important. It probably was desperately important. There is no way to know.

The Collapsed Building looms closer now, a wall of broken concrete and twisted rebar. The street is impassable beyond it.`,
