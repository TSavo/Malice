  description: `Washington Street passes along the northern edge of the Grand Central Building here, the arcade's ornate entrance visible in the facade. The arcade was Seattle's first indoor shopping center when it opened in 1890, its iron and glass construction revolutionary for the frontier city. The revolution became a landmark became a ruin, the glass cracked, the iron rusting, but the structure intact.

Occidental Park opens to the north, its dead trees visible over the low walls that separate the park from the street. The park was designed as an extension of the sidewalk, the boundary between public street and public plaza deliberately blurred. The blur persists—park and street equally empty, equally decaying, the distinction mattering less with each passing year.

A decorative clock is mounted on one building's corner, its hands frozen at a time that no longer matters. The clock was a landmark once, a meeting point—"I'll meet you at the Washington Street clock." The meetings ended. The clock waits, keeping time that no one needs.`,
