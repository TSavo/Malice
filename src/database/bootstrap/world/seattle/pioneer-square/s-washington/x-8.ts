  description: `Smith Tower casts its shadow here, the white terra cotta facade visible to the north. The tower has stood for over a century. It will probably stand for another. Some things refuse to die.

A print shop occupies the ground floor, its presses silent, its paper stock yellowed and curling. Business cards and wedding invitations and menus for restaurants that no longer exist. The proprietor's name is on the door. "CHEN'S QUALITY PRINTING." Mr. Chen's quality is no longer available.

A sandwich board on the sidewalk advertises a lunch special from before. Soup and half sandwich, $12.95. The price seems reasonable. The lunch is no longer being served.

The street continues east toward the park.`,
