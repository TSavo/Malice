// S. Washington St - approaching 3rd Ave

  description: `The rubble of the Collapsed Building spills into the street here, chunks of concrete and tangles of rebar and the shattered remains of what was once a workplace. The debris field extends for half a block, forcing the street to narrow around it.

A car is half-buried in the rubble, its rear end visible, its license plate still readable. Someone ran a check on that plate once, looking for the owner. They found a name and an address and a next of kin. The notification was never delivered.

Caution tape stretches across the debris pile, yellow and black and faded by weather. "DO NOT CROSS" it says. The message is clear. The enforcement is absent.

Third Avenue is just ahead, threading between the ruins.`,
