  description: `The Corp Construction site's perimeter ends here, the black fabric barriers giving way to the older buildings that line Washington Street's final blocks before 4th Avenue. The fence line creates a sharp boundary between the construction zone's mystery and the street's ordinary dereliction.

RUBY'S DINER claims the corner building, its chrome-and-glass facade preserved from a 1950s renovation that aimed for mid-century modern and achieved mid-century adequate. The interior is visible through plate glass windows: a long Formica counter with chrome stools bolted to the floor, red vinyl booths along the walls, the layout of a classic American diner designed for efficiency rather than ambiance. The neon sign above the door—RUBY'S in cursive script—is dark but intact.

The buildings along this stretch transition from Pioneer Square's Victorian brick to the more varied architecture of the International District ahead. The boundary between neighborhoods is gradual rather than sharp, marked by changes in signage language and storefront style rather than any formal demarcation.`,
