  description: `This is the center of Pioneer Square, or close enough. The park extends to the south, the buildings rise on all sides, and somewhere beneath the street, the original city lies buried and forgotten.

A coffee roaster once operated here, filling the air with the smell of beans from Ethiopia and Colombia and places that seem impossibly far away now. The roaster is silent. The beans are gone. The burlap sacks that held them are piled in the corner, rotting slowly into the floor.

A brass plaque set into the sidewalk marks the location of something historical. The plaque is green with oxidation, the words worn smooth by a century of feet. It probably explained something important. It probably does not matter anymore.

The street continues east and west. The underground is somewhere below. The surface is all that remains accessible.`,
