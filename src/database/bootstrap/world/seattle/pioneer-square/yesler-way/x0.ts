  description: `This is the center of Pioneer Square, or close enough. Occidental Park stretches south, its cobblestones cracked and heaved by decades of freeze-thaw cycles no one bothers to repair. The iron pergola is visible to the west, the Victorian structure rusted to a deep brown, its lattice roof collapsed in places where the climbing plants died and the weight of winters accumulated.

ZEITGEIST COFFEE occupies the corner, its windows dark, its espresso machines cold. Through the grimy glass: exposed brick walls, industrial lighting fixtures hanging dead from their cords. The morning crowds that once filled the outdoor tables are fifty-five years gone. The tables themselves were scavenged long ago.

Beneath the street, the original city lies entombed—the ground floors that became basements when Seattle raised its streets after the Great Fire. The Underground Tour departed from nearby once, guiding tourists through buried passages. The passages are still down there, darker now, the tours long ended. A city built atop itself, layers of abandonment all the way down.`,
