// Yesler Way - between 1st Ave and Occidental

  description: `A hotel once operated here, four stories of rooms with views of the park. The neon sign still clings to the facade, its tubes dark and broken. "HOTEL" it says. Just that. No name, no pretense, no promise of anything except a room.

The lobby is visible through the glass doors, marble floors and a reception desk and a rack of keys behind the counter. The keys are still there, hanging in neat rows, waiting for guests who will never check in. Room 214 looks popular. The key is missing.

A newspaper vending machine stands on the sidewalk, its window cracked, its coin slot jammed. The headline visible inside is from before. It talks about elections. It talks about the economy. It talks about things that mattered once.

Occidental Park is visible ahead, dead trees reaching over the rooftops.`,
