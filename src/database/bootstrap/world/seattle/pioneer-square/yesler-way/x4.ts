  description: `A parking structure rises on the south side, four levels of concrete and open-sided decks. Cars are still up there, visible through the open sides—lined up in neat rows on the upper levels, waiting for owners who will never return. Fifty-five years of waiting. The cars have rusted in place, tires flat, paint oxidized to uniform grey.

A row of storefronts lines the north side, their windows covered with plywood spray-painted with warnings and pleas and graffiti that stopped meaning anything decades ago. The buildings date to different eras—early twentieth-century brick beside mid-century concrete—but they share the same emptiness now.

Third Avenue and the Pioneer Square light rail station are visible ahead. The station entrance gapes dark, stairs descending into tunnels that haven't seen a train in half a century. The street slopes gently downward, following the grade toward a waterfront that's changed beyond recognition.`,
