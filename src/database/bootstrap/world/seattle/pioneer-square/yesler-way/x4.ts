  description: `The architecture transitions here from Pioneer Square's historic brick to mid-century concrete—the ugly buildings that replaced the beautiful ones after a fire in the seventies. Ironic that the ugly ones survived the war better. Concrete doesn't burn the way wood trim and ornamental terra cotta do.

A four-story office building occupies the south side, its aluminum-framed windows mostly shattered, aggregate panels stained with decades of rain and neglect. Ground-floor retail spaces are gutted, their contents looted in the early years when looting still seemed like a viable survival strategy. The storefronts gape open now, picked clean.

Yesler Way continues its gentle slope toward the waterfront, following the grade that Henry Yesler's original skid road established. Logs once rolled down this hill to the sawmill at the water's edge. Nothing rolls downhill anymore except rain and debris.`,
