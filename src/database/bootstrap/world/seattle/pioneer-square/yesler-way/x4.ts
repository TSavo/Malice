  description: `The character of the street changes here. The historic brick gives way to newer construction, cheaper materials, buildings that were built to last thirty years and have already exceeded their warranty.

A cell phone store occupies the ground floor, its inventory long since looted. The display cases are smashed, the phones gone, the charging cables scattered across the floor like dead snakes. A poster on the wall advertises unlimited data. The irony is not subtle.

Across the street, a temp agency with its door kicked in. The plastic chairs in the waiting area are overturned. The sign-in sheet on the counter has names and dates from before. People came here looking for work. They found it, or they did not, and then the world ended and none of it mattered.

The buildings are taller ahead, and darker.`,
