  description: `Mid-century concrete lines this stretch of Yesler Way, the utilitarian buildings that replaced older structures after a fire. They built for function, not beauty. Function has proven more durable than anyone expected.

A mixed-use building occupies the south side, four stories of apartments above ground-floor retail. Security bars still protect the storefront windows, the iron grilles rusted but intact. The bars kept people out for fifty-five years. The apartments above are dark, their intercom panel listing unit numbers for residents who stopped answering decades ago.

The street slopes gently downward toward the waterfront, following the grade that Henry Yesler's original skid road established. The timber industry is gone. The sawmill is gone. The slope remains, carrying rainwater and silence toward Elliott Bay.`,
