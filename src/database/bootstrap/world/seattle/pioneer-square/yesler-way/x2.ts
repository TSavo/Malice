  description: `The PIONEER BUILDING continues along the south side of the street, its red brick facade stretching nearly the full block. Most of the windows are intact, though a few on the upper floors have been replaced with plywood or plastic sheeting. The Romanesque arches frame dark interiors. The decorative terra cotta shows chips and cracks but has held together better than anyone expected.

A surface parking lot takes up the north side, surrounded by chain link fence topped with razor wire that someone added after the war. The razor wire is thorough. Whatever was worth protecting here is long gone. Weeds have cracked the asphalt into islands, each hosting its own ecosystem of dead grass and debris.

The Pioneer Building's fire escapes descend the rear facade in geometric zigzags, rusted solid in some places, collapsed entirely in others. The structure has stood since 1892. It will probably stand for another century. The people who built it understood permanence.`,
