  description: `The shadow of Smith Tower falls across the street here in the afternoon, or it would if the sun ever came out. The tower looms to the west, impossibly tall, impossibly still standing. Some things refuse to fall.

A bookstore occupies the corner space, its windows dark, its door propped open with a brick. The shelves inside are mostly empty, picked clean by scavengers looking for something to burn. A few hardcovers remain, too dense to be useful as kindling. Philosophy. Economics. The kind of books no one reads even in good times.

Across the street, a vacant lot where a building used to be. The foundation remains, a rectangle of concrete and rebar, filling slowly with rainwater and debris. A sign on the fence announces future development. The future has been cancelled.`,
