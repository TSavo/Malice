  description: `Yesler Way continues its diagonal path through Pioneer Square, cutting across the grid at the angle that has confused visitors for over a century. The triangular buildings that fill the odd-shaped lots give this stretch a distinctive character—narrow frontages, sharp corners, architecture adapting to geometry.

Smith Tower is visible to the south, its white terra cotta spire rising above the surrounding buildings. The tower was the tallest building west of the Mississippi when it opened in 1914, a claim to fame that Seattle cherished. The claim expired decades later when taller buildings rose. The tower remains, outlasting its superlatives.

A historic marker is mounted on one building, commemorating Yesler's original sawmill and the skid road that gave the street its name. The marker was installed in 1952, during an era when Seattle was trying to remember its past. The remembering became more urgent after the city forgot its future.`,
