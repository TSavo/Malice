  description: `The construction zone gives way to older buildings here, three and four-story structures that have weathered better than the newer construction. Early twentieth-century brick doesn't fail the way concrete does; the facades are stained and cracked but structurally sound after a century of use and half a century of neglect.

A convenience store occupies the corner, its security bars bent inward where someone forced entry long ago. The door hangs open on one hinge. Whatever was inside worth taking was taken in the first years after the war. The shelves are bare now, the coolers dark and silent.

Fourth Avenue and the International District are visible ahead. Signs in Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean still hang from buildings, their characters faded but legible—languages that outlasted the city that surrounded them. The transition between neighborhoods happens gradually, Pioneer Square's brick bleeding into Chinatown's red lanterns and ornate facades.`,
