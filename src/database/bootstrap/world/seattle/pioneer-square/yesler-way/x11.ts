  description: `The Corp Construction zone ends here, its fences and barriers giving way to older buildings that somehow survived whatever the corporation was building inside. The contrast is stark. Old brick beside black fabric. History beside secrecy.

A convenience store occupies the corner, its windows barred, its door reinforced with steel. Someone was serious about security. It did not help. The bars are bent, the door is open, and whatever was inside is gone now.

A bus shelter stands at the curb, its advertisement still visible behind cracked plexiglass. A smiling family. A vacation destination. "Paradise awaits." The family is still smiling. Paradise is still waiting. Neither of them knows what happened.

Fourth Avenue is ahead. The International District begins beyond it.`,
