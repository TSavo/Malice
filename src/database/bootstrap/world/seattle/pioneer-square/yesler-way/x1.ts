  description: `The park ends here. A brewpub occupies the corner building, copper tanks still visible through grimy windows. The tanks are empty now, the beer long since drunk or evaporated or turned to something worse. A chalkboard by the door lists beers with names like "Pioneer Stout" and "Skid Road IPA." The prices seem quaint.

Across the street, the Pioneer Building rises six stories of red brick and terra cotta. Built in 1892. Survived the fire that year, and every fire since. The windows are dark, the retail spaces at street level gutted, but the structure remains.

A brass plaque by the main entrance lists the building's history in careful detail. Fire of 1889. Rebuild of 1892. Renovation of 1974. Condo conversion of 2018. The plaque ends there. No one added what happened next.`,
