  description: `The street widens here into a plaza of sorts. Concrete and planters and benches with armrests in the middle. The armrests were designed to prevent sleeping. A small cruelty, in retrospect. There are worse ways to die than sleeping on a bench.

A bronze statue stands in the center, a man in work clothes holding a lunch pail. The plaque identifies him as a representation of "the workers who built Seattle." Pigeons roosted on his shoulders once. The pigeons are gone now. The traffic cone someone put on his head remains, sun-bleached orange fading to pink.

The Corp Construction zone dominates the south side. Through tears in the black fabric, crane arms reach into the grey sky. The skeleton of a building rises, steel beams and concrete cores and nothing else. No workers. No sound of construction. The project died mid-birth.

The statue gazes across the empty plaza. He built this city. He is welcome to it.`,
