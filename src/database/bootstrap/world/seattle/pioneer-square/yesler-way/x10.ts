  description: `The street widens into a small plaza, concrete planters and benches with center armrests—the defensive design that discouraged sleeping, back when anyone cared who slept where. The benches are empty now. The planters hold dead soil and the skeletal remains of ornamental shrubs.

A bronze statue stands at the plaza's center, a figure in work clothes holding a lunch pail. The plaque identifies him as representing "the workers who built Seattle." The workers are gone. The statue remains, lunch pail in hand, waiting for a shift that ended fifty-five years ago. Pigeons have claimed his shoulders and head, leaving white streaks down the bronze.

A construction site dominates the south side, its fencing rusted, its black fabric torn and flapping. Through the gaps: crane arms reaching toward grey sky, the skeleton of a building that was never completed. Steel beams and concrete cores and nothing else. The project died mid-birth, another monument to interrupted ambitions.`,
