// Yesler Way - between 1st Ave and Occidental

  description: `Red brick buildings line both sides of the street, four and five stories tall, built in the 1890s to last forever. They might actually make it. The decorative cornices are crumbling, the arched windows mostly broken, but the walls still stand. They built things differently then.

A coffee shop occupies a corner space. The windows are dark, the espresso machines silent, the sandwich board on the sidewalk still advertising "POUR OVER $7." Someone added "OVER MY DEAD BODY" underneath in marker. Comedy persists.

A tattoo parlor next door. Flash art still covers the windows, designs for anchors and roses and skulls. The skulls seem more relevant now.

The street continues east toward what used to be Occidental Park.`,
