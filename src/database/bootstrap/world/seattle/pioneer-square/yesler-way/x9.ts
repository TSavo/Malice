  description: `Third Avenue had a reputation. This was the street where trouble concentrated, where the police made their sweeps, where the news crews came for footage of urban decay. They worried about crime and homelessness and property values. They had no idea what trouble actually looked like.

The intersection is wide. A light rail station entrance gapes open to the north, stairs descending into darkness. No one has gone down there in a long time. No one comes up.

The southwest corner building is wrapped in chain link and black fabric, completely hidden. The fencing was thorough. The fabric is torn now, flapping in the wind, revealing glimpses of something behind it. Security cameras on posts still point at the perimeter. Their red lights are dark.

The northeast corner held a King County services building, all glass and bureaucratic purpose. The glass is mostly gone. Numbered tickets litter the lobby floor, scattered by wind and time. People waited in line for those tickets once. They waited for a lot of things.

The Corp Construction zone lies beyond, silent and still.

The light rail station was supposed to connect Pioneer Square to Downtown. When the tunnel collapsed, it took the street with it. The pavement north of here buckled and sank, forming a crater fifteen feet deep. Water fills the bottom now, black and still and deeper than it looks. The trains are down there somewhere. So are the passengers.`,
