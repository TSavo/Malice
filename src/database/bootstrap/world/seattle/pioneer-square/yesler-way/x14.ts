  description: `The last stretch before 4th Avenue. The buildings here are a mix of old and new, three-story walk-ups beside modern low-rises with underground parking. A dry cleaner with plastic-wrapped clothes still hanging in the window, waiting to be picked up. A nail salon with chairs arranged in neat rows. A restaurant with a faded awning and a menu in the window. The lunch special is pho. The lunch special has always been pho.

The food smells are gone now. The garlic and ginger and frying oil, replaced by dust and decay and the particular silence of empty kitchens. The woks are cold. The burners are dead. The recipes will not be passed down.

A plastic crate sits outside the restaurant, the kind someone might sit on while smoking a cigarette and watching the street change around them. The crate is empty. The street has finished changing.

Fourth Avenue lies ahead. Beyond it, what remains of Chinatown.`,
