  name: '4th Ave S & Yesler Way',
  description: `Fourth Avenue marks Pioneer Square's eastern boundary, where the historic district meets what was once Chinatown-International District. The transition is visible in the architecture—brick facades giving way to signs in Chinese characters, Victorian ornamentation to hanging red lanterns that have faded to pink and rotted to ribbons over fifty-five years.

A gas station occupies the corner, its canopy stained and sagging, its pumps rusted solid. The station served this intersection for decades before the war and has stood empty since. A sign still lists prices for gas that will never be pumped. The convenience store behind security bars is dark and stripped.

The ornate Chinatown gate is visible to the south, its dragons watching the empty street with painted eyes that have faded to suggestion. The gate represented community investment, the visible declaration that this place belonged to the people who built it. The people are scattered now. The gate remains, marking a boundary between one kind of emptiness and another.

Yesler Way continues east, named for the mill owner whose skid road became Seattle's first street. The timber is gone. The mills are gone. The street remains.`,
