  description: `Third Avenue approaches. The light rail used to run underground here. Sometimes, on quiet nights, you can still feel something in the pavement. A vibration. A rumble. Probably just settling. Probably.

PIONEER PAWN & LOAN occupies the corner, the three golden balls above the door tarnished green with age. The security-barred windows still display their inventory—guitars, tools, electronics—fifty-five years of dust coating everything. The proprietor kept his inventory right up until the end. The inventory remains, worth nothing now.

A dive bar occupies the opposite corner, its blacked-out windows and minimal signage unchanged from before the war. The neon sign just says "BAR"—no name, no pretense. The sign is dark now, the neon tubes dead, but the door stands slightly ajar, revealing only darkness within. Whatever song was playing on the jukebox when everything ended, it finished long ago.`,
