  description: `A parking garage dominates one side of the street, its concrete facade stained black in long vertical streaks. The entrance is a dark rectangle descending into the earth. No way to tell how deep the water goes.

Something happened in there. The blast marks around the entrance tell part of the story. The collapsed upper level tells the rest. Rebar hangs from broken concrete like exposed tendons.

Across the street, a building that might have been a hotel. Four stories of brick, the upper floors burned out, the windows empty sockets. A sign above the door reads "AFFORDABLE ARTIST LOFTS" in cheerful colors. The irony has aged well.

The street continues east and west. A narrow gap between buildings leads south, choked with debris.`,
