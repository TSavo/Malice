  description: `Second Avenue crosses Yesler Way here. A mural covers the corner building's brick facade, five stories of salmon swimming upstream in Coast Salish style—bold reds and blacks faded now but still visible, the fish heading somewhere they'll never arrive. The mural has outlasted the salmon runs it commemorated, outlasted the artists who painted it, outlasted nearly everything.

The street grid shifts at this intersection, a quirk of Seattle's founding visible in the misaligned blocks. North of Yesler Way, nothing quite lines up with what's south—two survey teams, two ideas of true north, a disagreement encoded in concrete and asphalt for two centuries and counting.

The corner buildings lean into each other slightly, the settling of foundations over decades creating a subtle tilt that's easier to feel than see. Four and five stories of brick and terra cotta, their facades stained with rain and time. The intersection sits at what used to be a boundary. Boundaries mean less now than they did.`,
