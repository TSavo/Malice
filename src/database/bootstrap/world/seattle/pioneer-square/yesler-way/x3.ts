  description: `Second Avenue crosses Yesler here. The traffic light still hangs from its pole, swaying slightly when the wind picks up. The lights do not work. Nothing works. But the pole remains, and the signal box, and the faded crosswalk paint on the cracked asphalt.

A mural covers one side of the corner building, five stories of salmon swimming upstream. Coast Salish art, bright reds and blacks against brick that has faded to match. The salmon are heading somewhere. They have been heading there for years. They will never arrive.

A bus stop shelter stands on the corner, its plastic panels yellowed and cracked. The bench inside is intact. The electronic sign above it is dark. The schedule posted behind scratched plexiglass lists routes and times that mean nothing now.

The street grid shifts slightly here. North of Yesler, the blocks no longer quite align with the ones to the south. Two surveyors, one city, two different ideas of which way was up. The argument is visible in every intersection.

Not that it matters now. The buildings on either side of 2nd Avenue leaned into each other when the shaking stopped, meeting in the middle like tired drunks. The gap between them is barely a foot wide at street level. Pigeons nest in there somewhere. Nothing larger gets through.`,
