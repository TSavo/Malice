  description: `A vacant lot breaks the streetwall on the south side. Plywood construction barriers surround it, covered in graffiti and wheat-pasted posters advertising concerts and protests and missing persons. The posters layer one over another, years of them, until the oldest are just fragments of color beneath the newest decay.

Through gaps in the barrier, concrete foundation and rebar reach toward the sky like broken fingers. A sign promises "THE YESLER" with "152 LUXURY UNITS." The sign is weathered, the construction obviously stopped mid-pour. A blue tarp is stretched between rebar posts in one corner. The tarp is empty now, but the smell remains.

A martial arts studio on the north side. The mirrored windows are shattered, reflecting the street in fragments. Through the jagged glass, heavy bags hang motionless, their leather cracked and split. Wooden practice weapons lie scattered on the mats. Someone left in a hurry. Or did not leave at all.

The wind makes a sound through the rebar. Almost like breathing.`,
