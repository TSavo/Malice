  description: `A construction site occupies the south side of the street, plywood barriers weathered grey surrounding foundation work that never progressed beyond rebar and poured concrete. A faded sign promises "THE YESLER" with "152 LUXURY UNITS." The luxury units were never built. The sign keeps promising.

RAIN CITY MARTIAL ARTS occupies a ground-floor space on the north side, its mirrored windows cracked and clouded, reflecting a distorted version of the street. Through gaps in the mirror: heavy bags hanging motionless, their leather cracked and split. Training mats covered in dust. The building's brick facade dates to the early twentieth century; the dojo opened sometime before the war and closed when everyone did.

Third Avenue approaches. The light rail used to run through here, connecting this neighborhood to downtown and beyond. The trains stopped. The tunnels remain, dark and silent beneath the street.`,
