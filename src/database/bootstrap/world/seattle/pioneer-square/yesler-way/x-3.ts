  description: `The PIONEER BUILDING dominates this intersection, six stories of red brick that have weathered better than most. Built in 1892, it survived the Great Fire that necessitated its construction and the war that ended everything else. The Romanesque arches frame windows that are mostly intact, a rarity. The corner turret still rises above the roofline, though pigeons have claimed it for their own.

ELYSIAN BREWING occupies the ground floor across the street, or did. The copper brewing tanks are visible through grimy windows, tarnished green-brown now, the beer long since drunk or evaporated or turned to something worse. The tap handles behind the bar are still there, pouring nothing.

This intersection marks the eastern edge of Occidental Park, where the cobblestone plaza gives way to cracked asphalt. The buildings maintain their historic facades—brick and terra cotta don't care about the passage of time the way glass and steel do.`,
