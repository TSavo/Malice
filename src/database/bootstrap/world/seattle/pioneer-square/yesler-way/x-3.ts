  description: `Occidental Park opens up here, a rectangle of dead trees and cracked cobblestones. The Victorian iron pergola still stands at the north end, holding up nothing, black paint flaking away to reveal rust beneath.

A totem pole rises near the pergola, carved figures stacked one atop another. The original was stolen from a Tlingit village in 1899. This is a replica of the replica that replaced it. Seattle has always been good at taking things and calling them its own.

The wooden figures stare outward with hollow eyes. Eagle. Raven. Bear. They have seen what happened here. They are not telling.

Benches line the paths, overturned or broken or simply empty. The cobblestones are cracked and heaved, weeds pushing through. Somewhere in the park, a door leads down into the underground.

Occidental should continue north here, but a mountain of debris blocks the way. When the blast wave hit, it funneled between the buildings and piled everything it carried right here at the grid line. Shopping carts and newspaper boxes and pieces of buildings and things that used to be people. No one has tried to clear it. No one will.`,
