  description: `Occidental Park's dead maple trees are visible ahead, their bare branches rising above the surrounding rooflines like skeletal fingers. The park opens just beyond this block, what's left of it.

FOSTER/WHITE GALLERY occupies a ground-floor space, its white walls visible through windows that haven't been cleaned in decades. The track lighting is dark. The abstract paintings and sculptures are still there—looters don't take art—displayed with the careful spacing that once conveyed value. The First Thursday art walks brought crowds through galleries like this. The crowds stopped coming. The art remains, appreciated by no one.

The UNDERGROUND TOUR entrance occupies a storefront across the street, the departure point for guided tours that explored Seattle's buried original city. After the Great Fire, Seattle raised its streets, entombing the original ground floors beneath the new surface. The tours ended when everything ended. The passages are still down there, darker now, the guides long gone. A city built atop itself, layer upon layer of abandonment.`,
