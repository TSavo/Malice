  description: `The intersection with 1st Avenue is visible ahead. So is the white tower that still stands there, somehow, defying gravity and good sense and whatever fell from the sky.

A check cashing place occupies a corner building, its windows long since smashed, its neon signs dark. "SE HABLA ESPANOL" one says. "PAYDAY LOANS" another. The promises of a dead economy preserved in plastic and gas.

Across the street, a soup kitchen. The serving window is shuttered with plywood. Someone painted a mural on the plywood, bright colors depicting people sharing a meal. The people in the mural look happy. That was probably the point.

A shopping cart lies on its side in the gutter, wheels pointing at the sky like the legs of a dead animal.`,
