  description: `Third Avenue is close. The light rail used to run underground here. Sometimes, on quiet nights, you can still feel something in the pavement. A vibration. A rumble. Probably just settling. Probably.

A pawn shop on the corner still has its window display: guitars with broken strings, power tools with corroded batteries, jewelry under glass that is now starred with cracks but not quite shattered. The three golden balls above the door are tarnished green. A handwritten sign reads "WE BUY GOLD - BEST PRICES." Another reads "NO HAGGLING." The proprietor kept his principles right up until the end.

Across the street, a bar with blacked-out windows. The neon sign just says "BAR." No name, no pretense. The heavy wooden door stands slightly ajar, revealing only darkness. A jukebox is visible inside, its colored lights dead, its records silent. Whatever song was playing last, it finished long ago.

The street is quiet. The doors hang open. Nobody is home.`,
