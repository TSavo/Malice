  description: `Yesler Way approaches Second Avenue, the intersection where two street grids collide. South of Yesler, Pioneer Square's streets run cardinal—north, south, east, west. North of Yesler, downtown's streets rotate thirty-two degrees to follow the shoreline. The collision was a surveying decision made in 1853. The consequences echo through every map ever drawn of Seattle.

The intersection itself is a knot of angles, streets meeting at corners that seem wrong to eyes trained on ninety degrees. Buildings on the corners adapted, their facades angled to face both grids, their floor plans compromising between orientations. The compromises are visible in the architecture.

The Pioneer Building rises to the east, its Romanesque bulk anchoring the intersection. The building was designed to be a landmark, visible from both grids, claiming the junction as its own. The claim was successful. The building still dominates views from every approach.`,
