// Yesler Way - along north edge of Occidental Park

  description: `The park stretches away to the south, a wasteland of dead trees and shattered paths. The buildings along the north side look down at it with dark windows and blank facades. Whatever happened here, they are not saying either.

A food cart sits at the curb, overturned, its griddle rusted solid. The hand-painted menu board lies face up on the sidewalk, still advertising hot dogs and tamales and something called a "Seattle Dog" which apparently involved cream cheese. The locals were proud of that. Strange thing to be proud of.

The cart's umbrella is gone. So is everything else worth taking. Just the shell remains, a monument to street food and better times.

The park continues to the south. The street runs east and west, empty and quiet.`,
