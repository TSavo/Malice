// Yesler Way - between 1st Ave and Occidental

  description: `Trees are visible ahead, or what is left of them. The dead branches of Occidental Park reach over the rooftops like skeletal fingers.

A gallery occupies the ground floor here, its windows displaying art that no one will ever buy. Abstract shapes in expensive frames, gathering dust. A red "SOLD" sticker on one piece. Optimistic.

Across the street, a door marked "UNDERGROUND TOUR" with a price list still posted. Ten dollars for adults, eight for seniors, five for children. The tours went down into the buried city beneath the streets, the original Seattle that was paved over after the fire of 1889. Now there are two dead cities stacked on top of each other.

The tour entrance is padlocked. Whatever is down there now, it is not a tourist attraction.`,
