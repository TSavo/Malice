  description: `Smith Tower casts its shadow across this block when afternoon sun breaks through Seattle's perpetual overcast, the white terra cotta facade stained grey but still visible to the west. The tower dominates the western view, rising above the surrounding four- and five-story buildings with the confidence of a structure that has stood for over a century and expects to stand for another.

PIONEER BOOKS occupies a corner space, an independent bookstore that served the neighborhood's literary community. Through the window: floor-to-ceiling shelves still packed with books—paperback fiction, academic volumes, philosophy and architecture. Looters don't take books. The inventory remains, organized by subject and author, appreciated by no one. The knowledge inside is patient. It can wait.

A vacant lot opens across the street, chain-link fence surrounding the foundation of a building that was demolished before the war. A sign on the fence displays architectural renderings of the mixed-use development that was planned for the site—standard imagery of urban development marketing, promises of luxury units and ground-floor retail. The development never happened. The sign keeps promising.`,
