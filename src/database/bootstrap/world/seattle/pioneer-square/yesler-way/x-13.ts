  description: `The street climbs away from the water here, each step taking you further from the smell of salt and rot. The buildings press closer together, brick walls stained with decades of rain and smoke and whatever else drifted down from the sky.

A furniture store occupies the ground floor of one building, its display window somehow intact. A dining set is arranged inside, table and chairs and place settings, as if waiting for a family that will never arrive. Dust covers everything. The price tag is still visible. It was expensive.

Across the street, a doorway leads into darkness. The sign above it is gone, leaving only bolt holes and a shadow where letters used to be. The door itself hangs open. No one has closed it in a long time.

The waterfront is downhill. The rest of the neighborhood is uphill. The choice is simple. The consequences are not.`,
