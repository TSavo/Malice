// Yesler Way - between Waterfront and 1st Ave

  name: 'Yesler Way',
  description: `The street climbs here, cracked asphalt buckled by roots and time and whatever else happened. Buildings line both sides, their windows dark or missing entirely. Glass crunches underfoot.

A bus shelter stands at the curb, its roof collapsed inward, the bench beneath buried in debris. The route map is still visible behind shattered plexiglass. It lists destinations that no longer exist.

The storefronts are gutted. A nail salon, maybe. A vape shop. Hard to tell now. Everything has been picked clean, leaving only empty shelves and scattered debris. Someone spray-painted "ALREADY LOOTED" on one door. Helpful.

The waterfront is visible downhill. The street continues uphill to the east.`,
