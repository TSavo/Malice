  description: `Yesler Way climbs eastward from the waterfront, following the grade that the original "Skid Road" established in the 1850s. Seattle's terrain still asserts itself against the street grid's attempt to impose order—the pitch noticeable here, buildings rising to meet the slope on stepped foundations.

A Metro bus stop marks this location, its shelter yellowed and cracked, its bench weathered grey. Route maps are still posted behind scratched plexiglass, showing connections to destinations that exist only in memory. The buses stopped running when the fuel ran out. The infrastructure remains, waiting for transit that will never come.

The ground-floor retail along this stretch is shuttered and dark: a nail salon, a convenience store, small businesses that served local foot traffic. The foot traffic ended. The businesses closed. The buildings are mixed construction—early twentieth-century brick beside mid-century renovation—all of it empty now, the accumulated development of a neighborhood that grew incrementally and died all at once.`,
