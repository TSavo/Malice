  description: `A narrow alley opens to the south here, disappearing between buildings into shadow. The alley is filled with dumpsters and fire escapes and the accumulated debris of a city that stopped cleaning up after itself. Something moved back there once. It might still be moving.

The buildings on either side are four stories of brick and iron, their facades decorated with the kind of ornate stonework that no one builds anymore. Carved faces peer down from the cornices, their features worn smooth by a century of weather. They have seen everything. They judge nothing.

A fire hydrant stands at the corner, its yellow paint chipped and faded. The cap is missing. Someone took it for scrap, or for a weapon, or just because they could. In this city, everything that can be taken will be taken eventually.

Smith Tower is visible ahead, rising above the rooftops like a white finger pointing at the sky.`,
