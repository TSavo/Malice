  description: `Occidental Park opens just ahead, the iron pergola visible at the north end of the pedestrian mall, leaning against Seattle's grey sky. The pergola's Victorian curves create a distinctive silhouette—decorative ironwork rusted brown, cast iron framework outlasting everything it was built to shelter.

YESLER LAUNDRY occupies a ground-floor space, a coin-operated laundromat that served the neighborhood's residential population. Through the grimy window: rows of front-loading washers and stacked dryers stand silent, their doors hanging open. The machines haven't run in fifty-five years. The last loads were never retrieved. Someone's clothes are still in there, rotted to fiber and stain.

The buildings along this stretch maintain the scale that historic preservation required: brick facades, decorative cornices, the architectural vocabulary established after the Great Fire. The preservation stopped mattering when everyone left. The buildings stand anyway, too solid to fall on their own.`,
