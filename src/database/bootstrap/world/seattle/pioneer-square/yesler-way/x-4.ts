  description: `The park is close now. The iron pergola is visible ahead, its Victorian curves black against the grey sky. It looks delicate from here. It is not. It has survived everything this city has thrown at it for over a century.

A laundromat occupies the ground floor here, its washers and dryers visible through the window. The machines are silent, their drums still, their doors hanging open. Someone's clothes are still inside one of the dryers, faded and forgotten. Whoever left them is not coming back for them.

The coin-op machines by the door still have prices listed. Two dollars for a wash. A dollar fifty for a dry. The coins inside are worthless now, but the machines still hold them, patient and stupid and waiting for a world that no longer exists.

A shopping cart sits outside, filled with blankets and cans. The owner is not in sight.`,
