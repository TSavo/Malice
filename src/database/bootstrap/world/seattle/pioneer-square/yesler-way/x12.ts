  description: `The last stretch before Fourth Avenue mixes old and new construction—three-story walk-ups beside modern low-rises, all of it dark, all of it empty. The buildings housed businesses that served transitional neighborhoods: dry cleaners, nail salons, the service economy that filled space between anchor tenants. The services ended. The anchor tenants left. The buildings persist.

A Vietnamese restaurant occupies a ground-floor space, its awning faded and torn, still advertising pho and banh mi. Through the grimy window: the open kitchen layout that noodle shops favor, steam tables rusted, prep stations bare. The restaurant represented the culinary culture of this neighborhood's eastern edge. The food smells are gone now—garlic and ginger and frying oil replaced by dust and decay.

Fourth Avenue is visible ahead. The ornate Chinatown gate stands a few blocks south, its dragons watching the empty street with faded eyes. The gate marked the boundary between communities. Boundaries mean less now.`,
