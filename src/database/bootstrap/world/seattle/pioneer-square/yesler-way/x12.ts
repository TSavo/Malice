  description: `The transition is visible here. Pioneer Square's brick and history giving way to the International District's signs in Chinese and Vietnamese and Korean. The signs are still there, faded but legible, marking restaurants and markets and services in languages that have outlasted this city before.

A social services building on the north side. The windows are dark, the doors locked or jammed. A line used to form here every morning. Now there is just the sign listing required documents and the faded tape marks on the sidewalk where people stood six feet apart. That was a different emergency. Simpler, in hindsight.

A poster on the construction fence advertises a community meeting about the development. The date was three months before everything ended. Someone wrote "THEY DIDN'T LISTEN" across it in red marker. They were talking about the development. They could have been talking about anything.

The street continues. The signs change languages. The silence stays the same.`,
