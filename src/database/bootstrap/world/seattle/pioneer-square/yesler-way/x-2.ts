  description: `The park extends to the south here, a wasteland of dead trees and broken paths. The iron pergola stands at the north end, closer now, its paint flaking, its purpose forgotten. It used to shelter a farmers market. Now it shelters nothing.

A pizzeria occupies the corner building, its ovens cold, its tables overturned. The menu is still posted in the window, handwritten on a chalkboard. Margherita. Pepperoni. Something called "The Works." The prices are listed in dollars. The dollars are worth nothing now, but the menu remains, a record of appetites that no longer matter.

The smell of baking bread used to fill this block. Now there is only the smell of rain and decay and the particular mustiness of buildings that have been wet too long.

The Pioneer Building is visible ahead, six stories of red brick and arched windows.`,
