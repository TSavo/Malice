  description: `Yesler Way begins its diagonal climb from the waterfront here, the original skid road that gave Seattle's Skid Row its name. Logs once rolled down this grade to Henry Yesler's sawmill at the water's edge, the first industry in a settlement that would become a city. The sawmill is a memory. The grade remains.

The diagonal cuts across the grid at an angle that confuses navigation, streets meeting at odd corners, lots assuming triangular shapes that architects struggled to fill. The confusion was built into the city's bones in 1853. It persists in the ruins.

The debris pile that blocks passage to downtown is visible ahead, the collapsed building's rubble forming a wall across the intersection with First Avenue. The only way through is along the waterfront, through the gap in the seawall. Everything else ends here, at the barrier that geography and gravity created.`,
