  description: `Yesler Way approaches Fourth Avenue at the Chinatown Gate's ruins, the collapsed structure blocking direct passage to downtown. The gate's fall created a physical barrier where there had only been a cultural one—the transition between Pioneer Square and the International District marked now by rubble rather than by architecture.

The collapsed gate's carved dragons lie among the debris, their painted scales faded to grey, their wooden bodies splintered by the fall. The dragons were meant to welcome visitors to Chinatown. Now they guard nothing but their own remains.

The light rail crater is visible to the west, its flooded depression marking the end of the street grid's coherence. Between the gate's rubble and the crater's water, Yesler Way becomes impassable to the north. The diagonal road that once connected neighborhoods now connects only ruins to ruins.`,
