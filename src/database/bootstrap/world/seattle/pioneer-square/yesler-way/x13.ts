  description: `A parking garage dominates the north side, five levels of concrete painted institutional beige that has faded to grey. The entrance ramp descends into darkness. Cars are still visible on the upper levels through the open sides, arranged in rows that haven't moved in decades. The garage provided automobile storage for urban workers who drove in each morning and home each evening. The routine ended. The cars remained.

A small urban park occupies the south side, more hardscape than landscape. The trees are dead, their bare branches stark against grey sky. The concrete benches remain, the drinking fountain dry and cracked. The park was a minimal amenity when it was built. It's less than that now.

Fourth Avenue approaches, the boundary between Pioneer Square and the International District. The neighborhoods blur together in their emptiness—brick facades and Chinese characters and red lanterns all equally abandoned.`,
