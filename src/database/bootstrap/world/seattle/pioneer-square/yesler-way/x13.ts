  description: `A parking garage dominates the north side, five levels of concrete painted institutional beige. The entrance ramp descends into darkness. A sign lists hourly and daily rates that seem quaint now. Another sign warns that management is not responsible for theft or damage. Management is not responsible for anything anymore.

The construction fence finally ends on the south side. A small park fills the space, more concrete than green. The trees are dead, their branches like veins against the sky. A drinking fountain stands in the center, its basin filled with leaves and debris. Blue tarps and shopping carts cluster along the back edge, arranged with care, abandoned with haste.

The tarps are empty. The shopping carts are full of things that mattered to someone. Blankets. Cans. A stuffed animal, face down in the dirt.

The city gave thirty days notice before the sweeps. The sweeps never came. Something else did instead.`,
