  description: `A parking structure rises on the south side of the street, four levels of concrete and rebar, its entrance blocked by a car that ran out of gas or hope or both. The driver is not inside. The keys are still in the ignition.

The structure itself is intact, its levels visible through the open sides. Cars are still parked up there, lined up in neat rows, waiting for owners who will never return. A convertible on the third level has its top down. It has been rained in for months.

Across the street, a row of storefronts, their signs faded, their windows covered with plywood spray-painted with warnings and pleas and the kind of graffiti that means nothing to anyone anymore.

Third Avenue is close. The light rail station is ahead, or what is left of it.`,
