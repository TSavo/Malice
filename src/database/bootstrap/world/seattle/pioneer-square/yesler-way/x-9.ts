  description: `Smith Tower rises at this intersection, thirty-eight stories of white terra cotta stained grey by decades of Seattle rain and neglect. The building dominated the skyline when it opened in 1914—tallest structure west of the Mississippi. The tower's neo-Gothic crown still creates the distinctive silhouette that identifies Pioneer Square, the Chinese guardian figures at each corner still watching over a city that's largely empty now.

The bronze doors at street level are tarnished green, the elaborate terra cotta ornament chipped and weathered. The building was too well-built to fall, too solid to fail. It stands like a tombstone, marking where Seattle's ambitions once reached toward the sky.

Yesler Way and 1st Avenue intersect here at a point that represents Seattle's geographic origins—two survey teams, two street grids, a disagreement encoded in asphalt that still confuses what little navigation happens now. The intersection marks where Pioneer Square's grid meets downtown's, the historical boundary between one kind of ruin and another.`,
