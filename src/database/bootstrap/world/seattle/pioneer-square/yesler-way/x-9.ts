  description: `Smith Tower rises here, thirty-eight stories of white terra cotta against the grey sky. It was the tallest building west of the Mississippi when they built it in 1914. A hundred years later, glass towers dwarfed it. Now those towers are rubble, and Smith Tower still stands. There is probably a lesson in that.

The bronze doors at street level are chained shut with padlocks that have rusted into solid lumps. A plywood sign reads "SMITH TOWER CONDOS - COMING SOON" in faded letters. The sign has been here for years. The condos will not be coming.

Yesler Way runs east and west. 1st Avenue runs north and south. This is where Seattle started. Two men laid out this city, and they disagreed about which way was north. You can see it in the way the streets do not quite line up. Some arguments never get settled.

The intersection is silent. No traffic. No signals. Just cracked asphalt and faded paint.

To the north, 1st Avenue should continue into Downtown. It does not. A six-story building collapsed across the street during the Event, its bricks and beams forming a wall that reaches from facade to facade. The street grids never quite aligned here anyway. Now they never will.`,
