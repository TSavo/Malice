  name: 'Mid-block Alley',
  description: `This alley cuts through the middle of the block, running east-west between 2nd and 3rd Avenues. It's the kind of space that existed purely for function—deliveries, garbage collection, the movement of goods that the streets proper were too civilized to accommodate.

The walls to either side are the backs of commercial buildings, showing their utilitarian nature. Metal doors marked LOADING ONLY and DELIVERIES and EMPLOYEES ONLY punctuate the brick and concrete surfaces. Most are closed and locked, some rusted shut, a few hanging slightly open.

The pavement here is rougher than the streets, less maintained even before the Event. Concrete and asphalt mixed unevenly, patched and repatched over decades. Cracks run everywhere, and in places the surface has broken through entirely to show the fill beneath.

A metal trash can lies on its side, dented and empty. Next to it, a wooden pallet has partially collapsed, its slats rotted through. These are the remnants of commerce, of activity, of a time when things moved through this space with purpose.

The alley continues east toward 2nd Avenue and west toward 3rd Avenue.`,
