  description: `The alley widens slightly here as Smith Tower's northern wall angles away. The building's corner is visible just ahead, where the alley would meet S. Washington Street if the debris weren't piled there—broken concrete, twisted rebar, the remains of something that fell or was pushed.

Smith Tower's wall shows more character here at the building's edge. A cornerstone, barely visible beneath decades of grime, bears the year 1914. Above it, decorative brickwork creates a pattern that was meant to be seen from neighboring buildings, back when this narrow space was part of the urban fabric rather than a forgotten gap.

The eastern wall belongs to a different building, something lower and less distinguished. Its windows here are small and set high, their glass either missing or too dirty to see through. A door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY in faded letters stands closed, its handle missing, a hole where the lock mechanism used to be.

The ground here gets fractionally more light than the sections to the south. Not enough to call it bright, but enough to see the weeds growing in the cracks, and the places where water has left mineral deposits on the concrete.

The alley continues south. To the north, debris blocks easy passage to S. Washington Street.`,
