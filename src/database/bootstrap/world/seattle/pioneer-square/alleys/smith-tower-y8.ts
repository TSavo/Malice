  name: 'Alley behind Smith Tower',
  description: `The alley continues its narrow path between Smith Tower's eastern wall and the buildings beyond. The shadows here are permanent, the sun never quite reaching the ground between these walls.

Halfway up Smith Tower's wall, maybe five meters up, a bricked-over archway is visible. Whatever entrance or loading bay it once was has been sealed for decades, the brickwork a slightly different color than the surrounding wall. The mortar is crumbling in places, revealing the hollow space behind.

A dumpster sits against the eastern wall, its lid gone, its interior long emptied of everything but rust and rainwater. Someone painted a symbol on its side once—a circle with radiating lines. The paint has faded to ghost gray.

The ground here slopes slightly north, encouraging water to flow that direction. The surface is cracked concrete, not asphalt, older than the streets themselves. You're walking on the original grade, the level Seattle sat at before the Great Fire and the subsequent regrading.

The alley stretches north toward S. Washington and south toward Yesler Way.`,
