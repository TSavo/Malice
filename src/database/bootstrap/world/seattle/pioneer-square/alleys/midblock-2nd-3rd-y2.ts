  description: `The alley continues its east-west path through the block's interior. Here the space narrows slightly where the buildings to either side weren't built quite parallel—different architects, different eras, different property lines creating an imperfect corridor.

A loading dock extends from the northern wall, its concrete platform raised to truck-bed height. The dock is empty except for a wooden pallet stack that has weathered to silver-grey. Above the dock, a metal awning provides minimal shelter, its surface crusted with rust and bird droppings from years of disuse.

The southern wall shows evidence of old modifications—bricked-over doorways, filled-in windows, patches where utilities were rerouted or removed. The buildings here have been rebuilt and repurposed multiple times over a century, each change leaving its mark.

A dumpster sits against the southern wall, its green paint almost entirely gone, the metal beneath pitted with corrosion. It's been here long enough that weeds have grown up around its wheels, anchoring it to the pavement like an artificial reef.

The alley runs east and west between the avenues.`,
