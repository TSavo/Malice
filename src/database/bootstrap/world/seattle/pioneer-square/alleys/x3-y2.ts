  description: `The avenue is at its narrowest here, buildings pressing close on both sides, blocking all but a strip of sky overhead. This is the darkest section of Second Avenue, where even at midday the shadows persist, deep and cool.

Fire escapes cling to both walls, their platforms creating a maze of metal overhead. In places the escapes almost meet, separated by only a meter or two, close enough that someone could jump from one building to the other if they were desperate or foolish enough.

The ground here slopes slightly, encouraging water to flow south. The pavement is ancient—original brick shows through where the asphalt overlay has failed, the bricks weathered but intact, bearing the impressions of century-old molds.

A metal trash can lies on its side, dented and empty. Next to it, a wooden pallet has collapsed into a pile of rotting slats. These are the remnants of commerce, of deliveries and pickups and the movement of goods through spaces that were purely functional.

The avenue continues north and south between the close walls.`,
