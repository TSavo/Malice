  name: 'Alley off Occidental Park',
  description: `The alley widens here where it meets the northern edge of Occidental Park. The fence ends, replaced by a low concrete barrier that once separated the park from the surrounding streets. The barrier is cracked, sections of it displaced or missing, making the boundary between park and alley more suggestion than barrier.

A metal gate across the alley once controlled vehicle access. The gate is gone now, only its mounting posts remaining, set in concrete that has cracked and heaved with the freeze-thaw cycles. The posts lean inward toward each other, as if bowing.

To the west, the park's northern plaza is visible—empty benches, dead trees, a information kiosk with shattered glass and faded maps of a neighborhood that no longer exists in the form those maps described.

The buildings to the east show their loading docks and service entrances. One dock still has its metal awning intact, the corrugated roof holding decades of rust. Below it, the dock platform is empty, its surface stained with patterns that might be oil or water or just time.

The alley opens onto S. Washington Street to the north. To the south, it continues along the park's edge.`,
