  name: 'Alley behind Grand Central',
  description: `The alley opens slightly here as it approaches S. Washington Street to the north. The buildings to either side pull back a few meters, creating a wider space that might once have been used for truck turnarounds.

The Grand Central building's northern wall shows evidence of old signage—rectangular shadows where letters once hung, bolt holes where lights were mounted. The business advertised itself even here, in the delivery alley where only workers would see it. That optimism is gone.

A dumpster sits against the western wall, its metal corroded to lace in places. Something has nested inside it—you can see the torn fabric and newspaper, but whatever made the nest isn't here now.

The ground here gets more sunlight than the narrower sections to the south. Weeds grow more aggressively, including blackberry brambles that have begun to climb the western wall.

S. Washington Street is visible to the north. The alley continues south behind Grand Central.`,
