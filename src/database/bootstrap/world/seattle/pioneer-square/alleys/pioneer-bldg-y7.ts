  name: 'Alley behind Pioneer Building',
  description: `The alley cuts between the back of the Pioneer Building and structures to the west. Six stories of brick loom to the east, the Pioneer Building's rear facade showing its utilitarian side—no ornamentation here, just functional surfaces designed for loading and service.

A loading dock extends from the building's wall, its concrete platform cracked and listing. The metal roll-up door above it is half-open, frozen that way, revealing darkness within. Whatever was being loaded or unloaded stopped mid-process and never resumed.

Fire escapes zigzag down the Pioneer Building's wall, their platforms visible as dark rectangles against the lighter brick. The lowest platform is maybe four meters up, its ladder permanently retracted or removed. A safety feature that's now an obstacle.

The western wall belongs to a lower building, three stories at most, its brickwork darker and less maintained. Windows here are small, their glass mostly intact but filthy, revealing nothing of the rooms behind them.

The alley continues north toward S. Washington. To the south, the way narrows as it approaches Yesler Way.`,
