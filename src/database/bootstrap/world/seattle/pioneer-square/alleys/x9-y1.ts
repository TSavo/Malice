  description: `Third Avenue narrows here, taking on the character of a service corridor. The buildings rise close on either side, their walls showing the backs and sides that face away from the proper streets—unfinished brick, painted-over windows, metal doors marked for deliveries.

A service entrance occupies the eastern wall, its metal door hanging slightly ajar, its frame bent, its lock broken. The gap is narrow, maybe ten centimeters, not enough to enter without forcing it wider, but enough to release the smell of enclosed air and mildew.

The western buildings show where utilities run—electrical conduits snaking up the walls, pipes that once carried water or gas, junction boxes crusted with corrosion. The infrastructure is exposed here, visible in a way it never was on the presentable streets.

Weeds push through cracks in the pavement, more aggressive here in the shadows. Blackberry vines have begun to climb the western wall, their thorns catching on the rough brick, their leaves dusty but alive.

Third Avenue continues north toward S. Washington and south toward S. Main.`,
