  description: `Occidental Avenue takes on an alley-like quality here, the buildings pressing close on both sides, their facades showing service doors and bricked-over windows rather than the ornate fronts they present to the main intersections.

A fire escape hangs from the eastern wall, its lowest ladder permanently retracted, its platforms visible as dark rectangles against the lighter brick. Someone welded bars across the first platform's access ladder—security that now prevents escape as much as entry.

Graffiti covers the lower walls here, layer upon layer accumulating over decades. The oldest pieces are barely visible beneath newer tags, all of it fading under weather and neglect. A few pieces show actual artistry—faces, words, abstract patterns—but most is just marking territory that no longer means anything.

A dumpster sits against the western wall, its metal corroded to lace in places. Something has nested inside—you can see torn fabric and newspaper—but whatever made the nest isn't here now.

The avenue continues north toward S. Washington and south toward S. Main.`,
