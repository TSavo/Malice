  name: 'Alley behind Grand Central',
  description: `The alley continues between buildings, narrow and shadowed. The Grand Central building rises to the east, its back wall windowless brick, designed never to be seen from the street. It's covered in old graffiti, layers upon layers, the oldest pieces barely visible beneath newer tags that are themselves fading.

A loading dock juts out from Grand Central's wall, its concrete platform waist-high, its metal roll-up door sealed shut. The dock is cluttered with debris—broken pallets, collapsed boxes, the skeleton of an old hand truck with one wheel missing.

On the western side, the backs of smaller buildings present a patchwork of materials—brick, concrete, corrugated metal. Windows here are small and high, designed to let light into storage rooms and kitchens. Most are broken or boarded over.

The ground is uneven, cracked asphalt giving way to exposed concrete where the paving failed. A puddle occupies a low spot, its water dark and still, reflecting nothing.

The alley runs north and south between the buildings.`,
