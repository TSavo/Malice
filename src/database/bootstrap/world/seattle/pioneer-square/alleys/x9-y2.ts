  description: `This section of Third Avenue functioned primarily as a delivery corridor, and it shows. Loading docks extend from both walls at intervals, their concrete platforms raised to truck-bed height, their roll-up doors now sealed with rust.

One dock still has its metal awning intact, the corrugated roof sagging but whole, providing shelter for a space that hasn't seen deliveries in months. Below it, the platform is empty except for water stains that pattern the concrete in abstract shapes.

A chain-link fence closes off part of the eastern side, its gate hanging open on one hinge. The fence once secured something—maybe dumpsters, maybe equipment—but whatever it guarded is gone. Only the fence remains, slowly rusting into irrelevance.

The pavement here is industrial-grade concrete, thicker and heavier than the asphalt used on residential streets. It's cracked but mostly intact, bearing the weight of decades of delivery trucks that no longer come.

The avenue continues north and south, maintaining its service corridor character.`,
