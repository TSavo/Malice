  description: `The alley continues its path between Occidental Park and the buildings beyond. Here the chain-link fence is in better condition, still standing mostly upright, though the posts lean at angles and the gate that once controlled access hangs permanently open.

Through the fence, the park is visible—the brick plaza, the metal sculptures that have oxidized into abstract shapes, the benches where people once sat to eat lunch. One bench has toppled onto its side. The others wait in rows, patient and abandoned.

The buildings to the east show more variety here—different heights, different materials, different ages of construction. A brick building with classical details stands next to a concrete structure from the 1960s that was already aging poorly before the Event. Now they age together, equally irrelevant.

A door in the concrete building stands open, its lock broken, its interior dark. The opening is just wide enough to see the trash that's accumulated inside—plastic bags, broken bottles, fabric so weathered it's impossible to tell what it once was.

The ground here is more level than the sections to the south, though still broken. Puddles form in the low spots, reflecting the narrow strip of sky visible between the buildings.

The alley stretches north and south along the park.`,
