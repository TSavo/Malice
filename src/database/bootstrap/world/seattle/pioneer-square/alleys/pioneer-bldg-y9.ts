  name: 'Alley behind Pioneer Building',
  description: `The alley widens as it approaches S. Washington Street, opening into a space that might once have been a small parking area or truck turnaround. The asphalt here is marked with faded lines, yellow paint that has weathered to the color of old bone.

The Pioneer Building's northern wall shows where a sign once hung—bolt holes arranged in a pattern, shadows on the brick where the metal blocked the weather. The sign is gone, taken or fallen, leaving only its ghost.

A chain-link fence closes off part of this wider area, its gate hanging open on one hinge. The fence was meant to secure something—maybe dumpsters, maybe equipment—but whatever it guarded is gone. The fence remains, pointless, slowly rusting into failure.

On the western side, the backs of buildings present their service faces—electrical conduits, exhaust vents, panels that once gave access to utility meters. Most are damaged or missing, leaving rectangular holes in the walls.

S. Washington Street is visible to the north. The alley continues south behind the Pioneer Building.`,
