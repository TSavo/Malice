  description: `The stadiums rise to the south, their scale still dominating the view. T-Mobile Park's retractable roof and Lumen Field's distinctive cantilevers establish the visual identity of what was Seattle's stadium district—architecture designed to assert major league status. The structures were designed to be seen. They are still seen. They are not used.

RALLY HOUSE occupies a retail space at this corner, its windows still displaying merchandise that sports fandom once generated: Mariners green and navy faded by sun, Seahawks blue and green dusty behind glass. The inventory arranged by team and sport commemorates allegiances that no longer matter. The teams are gone. The fans are scattered. The merchandise waits to be purchased by no one.

The security infrastructure of the stadium complex is visible from here: fencing defining venue perimeters, turnstile arrays at entrance gates rusted shut, camera housings pointing at nothing. The surveillance evolved after 9/11. It didn't evolve for what came after the war.`,
