  description: `The stadiums loom to the south, their scale overwhelming at this distance. They were designed to be seen, to dominate the skyline, to declare that this city was a major league city. The declaration stands. The league has been suspended.

A souvenir shop sold foam fingers and rally towels and things that helped fans feel like part of something bigger. The fans are gone. The souvenirs remain, sized for hands that aren't there, colored for teams that don't play.

A security gate blocks a stadium entrance, its turnstiles locked, its scanners dark. The security was meant to protect the crowds from threats. The threats turned out to be something the security couldn't scan for.`,
