  description: `A plaza opens up here, one of the gathering spaces designed to handle pre-game crowds. Food trucks would line up along the edges, selling everything from teriyaki to tacos. The trucks are gone. The plaza is empty. The concrete remembers feet that no longer walk.

A fountain stands in the center of the plaza, its jets silent, its pool stagnant. Someone threw coins into the water, making wishes that seem quaint now. The coins are still there, their wishes ungranted, their copper turning green.

Seagulls have claimed the plaza, treating it as their own. They're not wrong. It is theirs now.`,
