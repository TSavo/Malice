  description: `The International District's density reaches its maximum here, buildings packed together in the tight configuration that Asian urban neighborhoods favored. The vertical stacking shows through the decay: retail on the ground floor dark and empty, professional services on the second floor with windows smashed, residential above with curtains still hanging behind broken glass. The density that once meant community now means concentrated abandonment.

SHANGHAI HAND-PULLED NOODLES occupies the ground-floor space, its kitchen cold, its dining room dusty. The restaurant specialized in the la mian tradition—noodles stretched and pulled by hand, the technique that creates texture machine-made noodles can't replicate. The pass-through window to the kitchen frames rusted equipment and empty prep surfaces. Photographs of menu items still line the walls, faded and water-stained, the visual ordering system serving no one who can order.

The building's upper floors house HARMONY ACUPUNCTURE on the second level, its windows dark, its treatment rooms abandoned. Apartments occupy the floors above, their fire escapes rusted, their residents fifty-five years gone. The needles and herbs that promised to restore harmony couldn't restore what the war took.`,
