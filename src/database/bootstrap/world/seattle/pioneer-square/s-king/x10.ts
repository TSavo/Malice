  description: `The density of the International District increases here, buildings pressed close together, businesses stacked on top of each other. A noodle shop on the ground floor, an acupuncturist on the second, apartments above. Layers of life in a vertical stack.

The noodle shop was famous for its hand-pulled noodles, the chef stretching dough into strands with practiced ease. The pulling has stopped. The dough has dried. The fame lives on in memories held by no one present.

A menu board outside lists dishes in Chinese and English and photographs. The photographs show food that was delicious. The deliciousness is historical.`,
