  description: `A pharmacy occupies the corner, one of the last neighborhood pharmacies that hadn't been absorbed by chains. The pharmacist knew customers by name, remembered their prescriptions, asked about their families. The families are gone. The prescriptions are unfilled.

The pharmacy sold both Western medicine and traditional remedies, serving a community that believed in both. The beliefs continue. The remedies wait behind the counter, their healing properties intact.

A calendar on the wall shows a month from the past, its squares checked off up to a day when checking stopped mattering.`,
