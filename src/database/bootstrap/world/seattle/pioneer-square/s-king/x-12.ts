  description: `A homeless encampment occupied this stretch of street before. The tents are gone now, cleared by whatever cleared everything else. But the evidence remains: scorch marks from cooking fires, scattered belongings, the archaeology of survival.

A shopping cart lies on its side, its wheels still spinning slightly in the wind. It contains nothing now. It contained everything someone owned, once.

The buildings here are industrial, their windows high and small, designed to let in light but discourage curiosity. The curiosity has stopped. The light continues, indifferent.`,
