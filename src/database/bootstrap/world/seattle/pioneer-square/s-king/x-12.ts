  description: `The corridor where the Alaskan Way Viaduct once passed overhead opens here, the wide right-of-way that the demolished highway left behind. The viaduct came down in 2019, replaced by a tunnel beneath downtown. City planners intended this space for parks and development. The war happened instead. The intentions remain unrealized, fifty-five years of weeds and decay where urban renewal was supposed to occur.

The buildings along this stretch are industrial—concrete-block construction, windows broken or boarded. PIONEER BUILDING MATERIALS, faded signage reads, the kind of business that served the construction industry before construction stopped. The inventory is probably still inside. Building materials don't spoil. They just wait.

The viaduct's former alignment is legible in the landscape: the spacing between buildings, the abandoned foundations where support columns once stood, vacant lots surrounded by chain-link fence that's rusted through in places. The investment never came. The real estate market died with everything else.`,
