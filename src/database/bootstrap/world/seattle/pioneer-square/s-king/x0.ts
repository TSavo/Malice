  description: `The light rail station entrance descends into the earth nearby, the International District/Chinatown Station serving a transit system that no longer transits. The escalators are frozen. The platforms are empty. The trains sit in tunnels, waiting for passengers who will never arrive.

A street musician's spot is marked by a stain on the concrete, years of foot traffic wearing a different pattern where the audience gathered. The musician is gone. The audience is gone. The stain remains, abstract art created by appreciation.

A utility box on the corner has been covered in stickers and graffiti, layers of expression from people who needed to say something. The something has been said. No one is listening.`,
