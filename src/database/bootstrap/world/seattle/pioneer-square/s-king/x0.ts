  description: `Second Avenue intersects S. King Street at what was once a primary approach to the stadium complex. The street is wider here than typical, extra lanes and broader sidewalks accommodating thousands of fans who no longer flow through. The game days ended. The infrastructure that served them remains, oversized for the emptiness it now accommodates.

The Stadium Station entrance descends at the corner, the light rail stop that connected the stadiums to the regional transit network. The entrance canopy shelters escalators frozen mid-step, leading to underground platforms that haven't seen a train in decades. The infrastructure of mass transit serves no mass. The transit stopped.

The intersection's corners show the infrastructure of event-day commerce that no longer operates: designated vendor spaces empty, utility hookups capped and corroded. Second Avenue stretches north from here toward Pioneer Square's historic core, one kind of abandonment leading to another.`,
