  description: `The International District's southern edge begins here, the neighborhood's character asserting itself in signage and architecture. A Vietnamese restaurant occupies the corner, its menu posted in the window, its kitchen cold.

The restaurant was famous for its pho, beef broth simmered for hours, served to workers and tourists and anyone with the sense to appreciate it. The broth has cooled. The fame is a memory.

A Buddha statue sits in the window, golden and serene. The Buddha has seen civilizations rise and fall. This is just another one. The serenity continues.`,
