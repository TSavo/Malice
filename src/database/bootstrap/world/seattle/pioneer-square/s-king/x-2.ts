  description: `Second Avenue approaches from the north, the intersection ahead once serving as one of the main pedestrian approaches to the stadium complex. The street design reflects event-day priorities: wider than typical for the neighborhood, with turn lanes and signal timing optimized for crowd surges that haven't surged in fifty-five years.

A Seattle Police Department substation occupies the corner building, the satellite facility that law enforcement maintained in the stadium district. The building's institutional design—minimal windows, secured entrance—is intact. The patrol vehicles are gone, the parking spaces empty, the law enforcement presence that deterred opportunistic crime no longer present. Opportunistic crime found other deterrents, eventually.

A memorial plaque mounted on the building's facade commemorates officers who served in the stadium district. The brass is weathered green, the names still legible but softened by oxidation and decades of Seattle rain. The officers being honored are dead now, one way or another. So is everyone else.`,
