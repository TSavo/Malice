  description: `King Street Station rises to the south, its Beaux-Arts facade a monument to the age of rail travel. The station served passengers heading north to Vancouver and south to Portland and east across the mountains. The passengers have stopped traveling. The station waits for departures that won't depart.

The clock tower shows the correct time, maintained by some mechanism that doesn't require human intervention. The trains ran on time, once. Now time runs without trains.

A taxi stand occupies the curb, its sign still posted, its queue nonexistent. The taxis are gone. The stand remains, awaiting fares that will never hail.`,
