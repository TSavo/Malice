  description: `A public plaza opens here, one of the gathering spaces that stadium district planning included for crowd management. The decorative brick paving is cracked and pushed up by weeds, the planters along the edges holding dead soil and whatever hardy plants survived fifty-five years without maintenance. The plaza was designed to accommodate thousands of people. No thousands have gathered here in decades.

A fountain occupies the plaza's center, its bronze waves dry and verdigrised, its spray patterns silent. The fountain incorporated maritime imagery that Seattle's public art often references—stylized waves evoking Puget Sound. The Sound is still there. The water stopped flowing through the fountain when the pumps failed.

The plaza's edges show the utility hookups where mobile vendors once parked, the infrastructure that food truck operations required. The bollards still define the pedestrian zone. Pedestrians don't need protection from vehicle intrusion anymore.`,
