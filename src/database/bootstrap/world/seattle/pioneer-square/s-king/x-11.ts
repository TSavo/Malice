  description: `A cold storage facility occupies the south side of the street, the windowless bulk of refrigerated warehouse construction. PACIFIC COLD STORAGE, the faded letters read. The company served the seafood industry's need to maintain catch at temperatures that prevent spoilage. The refrigeration compressors on the roof are silent now, rusted solid. Whatever was in the freezers when the power failed is best not thought about. Fifty-five years of decay sealed behind insulated walls.

The loading docks face the street, roll-up doors rusted shut. Safety signage still marks the work zones: HARD HAT AREA, FORKLIFT TRAFFIC. OSHA doesn't require anything anymore. The hard hats are probably still hanging on their hooks.

SEATTLE PRECISION MACHINING occupies the building opposite, the kind of facility that fabricated custom parts for the industries the waterfront supported. The precision is frozen in place now—lathes and mills waiting for operators who'll never return, the patient machines holding their last calibrations.`,
