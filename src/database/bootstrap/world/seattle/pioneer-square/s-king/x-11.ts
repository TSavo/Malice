  description: `A cold storage facility looms on the south side of the street, its refrigeration units silent, its contents best left unimagined. The facility served the fishing industry, kept the catch fresh for market. The market has closed. The catch has been sitting.

The loading docks are empty, their roll-up doors frozen half-open. Forklifts sit abandoned on the concrete, their propane tanks empty, their forks raised in permanent surprise.

A sign on the door says HARD HAT AREA. The hard hats are gone. The area doesn't care.`,
