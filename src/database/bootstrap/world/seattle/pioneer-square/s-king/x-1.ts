  description: `Union Station is visible to the north, its grand hall converted to offices before the offices were converted to emptiness. The station was meant to be a gateway, a point of arrival and departure. Now it's just a building with good bones and no purpose.

A sandwich shop served the commuters who passed through here, quick lunches for people with somewhere to be. The commuters are gone. The shop is dark. The bread has molded and been consumed by things that don't mind mold.

A clock hangs in the shop window, stopped at some arbitrary time. The time doesn't matter. All times are the same now.`,
