  description: `Occidental Avenue is just ahead, its intersection marking the northern edge of the stadium complex. The cobblestones of the Occidental Mall are visible to the north, a different character, a different emptiness.

A brewery occupies the corner, one of Seattle's craft breweries that sprung up when craft beer was a thing people cared about. The fermenters are still. The taps are dry. The beer that was aging has finished aging, for better or worse.

A chalkboard outside lists beers that were on tap when the chalk was fresh. IPAs and stouts and seasonal offerings. The seasons have changed. The chalk has faded. The offerings have expired.`,
