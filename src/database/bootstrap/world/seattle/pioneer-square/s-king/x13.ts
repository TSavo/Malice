  description: `A temple occupies the upper floors of a building here, its entrance marked by a narrow doorway and a sign in Chinese characters. The incense that burned here scented the whole block, sandalwood and offerings rising to wherever offerings go.

The incense is cold now. The offerings untended. The deities worshipped here continue their existence, indifferent to whether anyone is worshipping.

A stone guardian lion sits at the base of the stairs, one of a pair. Its partner is on the other side, both facing outward, protecting a threshold that needs no protection from threats that don't come this way.`,
