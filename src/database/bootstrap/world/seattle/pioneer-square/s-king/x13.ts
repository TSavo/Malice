  description: `King Street approaches Fourth Avenue, the eastern boundary of Pioneer Square where the historic district meets the International District. The architecture shifts definitively here—Chinese and Japanese signage becomes more common, the buildings lower and more practical, the Victorian ornamentation giving way to functionality.

The condemned block is visible to the north, its toxic perimeter marked by faded warning signs. The contamination's edge runs close to the street here, close enough that the pavement shows discoloration from whatever seeped out during the early years. People walk on the southern side, giving the stains a wide berth.

A traditional Chinese gate once stood at this intersection, marking the entrance to Chinatown. The gate fell during the burning, its carved wood and painted pillars collapsing across the street. The debris has been partially cleared, enough to pass through, but the symbolism of the fallen gate remains.`,
