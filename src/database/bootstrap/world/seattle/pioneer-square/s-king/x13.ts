  description: `A Chinese temple occupies the upper floors of this building, its entrance marked by a narrow doorway and signage in traditional characters weathered but legible. Temples like this one served the spiritual needs of immigrant communities, maintaining religious practices carried across the Pacific. The building's upper floors were converted for worship—altars and ceremonial space for Buddhist and Taoist traditions. The gods that were honored here receive no offerings now. The incense has long since burned out.

A pair of stone guardian lions flanks the temple entrance at the base of the stairs, the foo dogs that traditional architecture places at thresholds. The sculptures are substantial—carved granite, their poses formal and protective—the community investment visible in their quality. The lions face outward in traditional configuration, still guarding a threshold no one crosses. Their protection extended to nothing that mattered when the war came.

The building's ground floor housed a gift shop selling temple supplies: incense, ceremonial paper for burning, prayer beads and devotional objects. The inventory is dust-covered behind grimy glass, the jade figurines and decorative items waiting for tourists who will never arrive. The souvenirs of Chinatown visits, unsold and forgotten.`,
