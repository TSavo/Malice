  description: `A Chinese grocery occupies the ground floor here, its produce bins empty, its shelves still stocked with things that don't spoil quickly. Dried mushrooms and canned bamboo shoots and sauces that came from the other side of the Pacific.

The store served a community that valued these things, ingredients for recipes passed down through generations. The generations have been interrupted. The recipes wait.

A red paper banner hangs over the door, its characters promising good fortune. The fortune has been mixed. The banner continues its promise anyway.`,
