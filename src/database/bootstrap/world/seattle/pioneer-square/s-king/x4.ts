  description: `The Corp Construction zone's southern boundary is visible here, its black fabric barriers marking the edge of whatever they were building. The zone doesn't extend this far south, but its presence is felt, a looming mystery that shadows the neighborhood.

A surface parking lot occupies the block, its painted lines fading, its numbered signs pointless. The lot charged premium rates on game days. The games are over. The premiums have been cancelled.

A lone car sits in the far corner of the lot, its tires flat, its windows dusty. Someone parked here and never came back. The parking fee has accumulated to infinity.`,
