  description: `Third Avenue intersects S. King Street at what was once the commercial heart of the International District, the intersection where foot traffic from multiple directions converged. The transit center is blocks away—not that transit runs anymore. The pedestrian flow that supported the retail density is fifty-five years gone. The density remains. The pedestrians don't.

Hing Hay Park is visible to the north, the neighborhood's central gathering space overgrown and silent. The park's pagoda pavilion—a gift from Taipei commemorating the sister-city relationship—rises above the surrounding rooflines, its curved eaves weathered, its red columns faded to rust-pink. The landmark that identified the International District still identifies it. The community it served is scattered or dead.

PACIFIC WIRELESS occupies the corner building, its windows smashed, its inventory long since looted. The mobile phone retailer served the neighborhood's communication needs—smartphones, prepaid plans, international calling cards that let immigrants call home. The window displays are empty now. The phones are gone. The networks they connected to are gone. Home, for most of these families, is gone too.`,
