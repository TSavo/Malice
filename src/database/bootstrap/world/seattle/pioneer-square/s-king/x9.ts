  description: `Third Avenue crosses S. King Street at the heart of the International District's commercial strip. The intersection was always busy, foot traffic from the transit center mixing with shoppers and residents and tourists seeking authentic experiences.

Hing Hay Park is visible to the north, its pagoda pavilion rising above the surrounding buildings. The pavilion was a gift from Taipei, a symbol of sister city friendship. The friendship persists across an ocean neither city can cross.

A phone store occupies the corner, its window displaying devices that connected people to everything. The connections have been severed. The devices are dark. The everything has become nothing.

The intersection is clear. Third Avenue runs north and south. S. King continues east and west.`,
