  description: `First Avenue is just ahead, marking the transition from industrial waterfront to urban neighborhood. The character of the buildings shifts here, warehouses giving way to mixed-use structures with retail on the ground floor.

A dive bar occupies the corner, its neon sign dark but intact. The bar served the port workers and the railroad men and the people who did hard work for not enough money. The workers are gone. The bar remains, ready to serve drinks that won't be ordered.

A pool table is visible through the window, its felt faded, its balls racked and waiting. The game will never be played. The rack will never be broken.`,
