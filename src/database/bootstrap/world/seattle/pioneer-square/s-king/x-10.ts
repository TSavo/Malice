  description: `Lumen Field rises to the south, the football stadium's distinctive roof structure visible above surrounding development. The Seahawks played here from 2002 until the war ended professional sports. The stadium was designed to amplify crowd noise through its partially enclosed bowl. The bowl is silent now. The acoustics amplify nothing but wind.

SEAHAWKS PRO SHOP occupies a corner retail space, its windows still displaying inventory: Action Green and College Navy arranged on mannequins faded by decades of sun. The jerseys commemorate players no one remembers. The fan base that supported Pacific Northwest football scattered or died or forgot that football ever mattered.

A bronze statue stands outside the shop, a player captured mid-motion, frozen in a pose that sports sculpture favors. The statue commemorates a franchise legend. The plaque on the base bears career statistics—touchdowns, yards, the numerical achievements that justified commemoration when numbers meant something. The statue watches an empty street, waiting for crowds that will never come.`,
