// S. King St - approaching 1st Ave

  description: `The streetscape transitions here as S. King approaches 1st Avenue, industrial architecture giving way to mixed-use buildings. The buildings gain stories—two and three floors rather than single-story warehouses—and ground floors show storefronts rather than loading docks. The storefronts are dark. The loading docks are silent.

THE SHIPYARD TAVERN occupies a corner building, a dive bar that served waterfront workers who needed somewhere to drink after shift. Through the grimy window: pool tables visible in the dim interior, a long bar backed by bottles no one has poured from in decades. The neon beer signs are dark, their tubes dead. The building shows its age—original wood paneling, tin ceiling tiles that early twentieth-century construction favored, all of it covered in dust.

The buildings along this stretch date to the 1920s and 1930s, brick facades replacing corrugated metal as Pioneer Square's southern boundary transitioned from pure industrial to commercial. The commercial development stopped. The bricks remain.`,
