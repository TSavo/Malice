  description: `The railroad tracks cross the street here, same as they cross every street in this district. The trains carried freight from the port to everywhere else. Everywhere else stopped receiving. The tracks rust quietly.

A rail yard is visible to the south, its switching equipment frozen, its boxcars coupled and still. The cars contain things that were being shipped somewhere. The somewhere is no longer accepting deliveries.

A crossing signal stands at the edge of the tracks, its lights dark, its bell silent. The signal was meant to protect pedestrians from trains. The trains aren't running. The pedestrians aren't walking. The protection is unnecessary.`,
