  description: `Second Avenue crosses S. King Street at one of the main arteries to the stadium complex. The street is wide here, built for the surge of humanity that came for games. The surge has receded. The width seems wasteful now.

A light rail station entrance descends nearby, connecting the stadiums to the rest of the city. The connections have been severed. The entrance leads to platforms that lead to tunnels that lead to darkness.

A hot dog cart sat here on game days, its vendor shouting prices and options. The cart is gone. The prices are irrelevant. The options have been reduced to one: move forward or don't.

The intersection is clear. Second Avenue runs north and south. S. King continues east and west.`,
