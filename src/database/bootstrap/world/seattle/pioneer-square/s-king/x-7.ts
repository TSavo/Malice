  description: `The street passes through a canyon of parking garages here, multi-level structures built to absorb the thousands of cars that came for games and concerts. The cars are gone. The structures remain, empty and echoing.

A pedestrian bridge connects two garages overhead, allowing fans to cross the street without touching ground. The bridge is still there, spanning nothing, connecting empty to empty.

A pay station stands at each garage entrance, screens dark, receipts unprinted. The parking was expensive. Now it's free. Now everything is free.`,
