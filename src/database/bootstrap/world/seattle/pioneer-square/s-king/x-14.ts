  description: `The street rises from the waterfront through the remains of Seattle's industrial past. Warehouses and machine shops and businesses that required heavy equipment and strong backs. The equipment is still. The backs are gone.

A marine repair facility occupies one building, its dry dock visible through open bay doors. A boat sits on blocks inside, its hull half-scraped, its repair interrupted by something more pressing than barnacles.

The smell of diesel and salt water lingers, ghosts of an industry that kept the waterfront alive. The industry is dead. The smells persist, fading slowly.`,
