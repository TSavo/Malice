  description: `Fourth Avenue crosses S. King Street at the southeastern corner of Pioneer Square's grid. The International District stretches in every direction from here, its character fully established, its silence identical to everywhere else.

A dragon gate spans the street to the east, its red columns supporting a traditional curved roof. The gate was built to mark the entrance to Chinatown, a declaration that you were entering somewhere different. The somewhere different is the same as everywhere now.

A bank occupies the corner, its multilingual signs welcoming customers in English and Chinese and Vietnamese. The customers are gone. The welcome continues, extended to no one.

The intersection marks the corner of the grid. Fourth Avenue runs north. S. King runs west. The district extends to the east, patient and waiting.`,
