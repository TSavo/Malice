  description: `First Avenue crosses S. King Street at the southwestern corner of Pioneer Square proper. The stadiums are visible to the east, their massive structures dominating the horizon. T-Mobile Park and Lumen Field, temples to baseball and football, built with public money and private profits.

The stadium district begins here. Everything is scaled for crowds: wide sidewalks, large plazas, restaurants that could seat hundreds. The crowds are gone. The scale seems absurd now, infrastructure for gatherings that will never gather.

A ticket office occupies the corner, its windows dark, its future games unlisted. The tickets are worthless. The games are cancelled. The season has been permanently postponed.

The intersection is clear. First Avenue runs north and south. S. King continues east and west.`,
