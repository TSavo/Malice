// S. King St - approaching Occidental

  description: `Occidental Avenue approaches from the north, the intersection ahead marking the transition between the stadium district and Pioneer Square's historic pedestrian mall. The cobblestones of Occidental's pedestrian stretch are visible beyond, cracked and heaved but still distinct from the asphalt that stadium traffic required.

PYRAMID ALEHOUSE occupies the corner building, one of Seattle's craft breweries that established taprooms to capture event-day traffic. Through grimy windows: the fermentation tanks still standing, copper tarnished green, the serving bar backed by tap handles that pour nothing. The brewing equipment visible through large windows was meant to be production as performance. The performance ended. The equipment remains.

The buildings at this corner represent the stadium district's architectural character: newer construction designed to serve event-day crowds that no longer exist. The scale is larger than Pioneer Square proper, the facades less ornate, the ground floors configured for high-volume hospitality that has been reduced to silence.`,
