  description: `S. King Street rises eastward from the waterfront through what was once Seattle's maritime industrial district. The buildings are utilitarian—steel frames and corrugated siding rusted brown, the architecture of function rather than aesthetics. Machine shops and fabrication facilities clustered here to serve commercial shipping. The shipping stopped. The facilities stand empty.

PUGET SOUND MARINE SERVICES occupies a large facility on the south side, its roll-up doors rusted shut, its dry dock filled with stagnant water. The ceiling heights that once accommodated cranes and hoists now shelter nothing but darkness and the nests of whatever birds have claimed the rafters.

The street's grade increases as it climbs away from filled tideflats. The original shoreline was blocks to the east; everything between here and there is fill—sawdust and mill waste and construction debris that Seattle dumped to extend the usable land. The fill is settling now, without maintenance. The buildings tilt slightly, foundations shifting in unstable ground.`,
