  description: `Second Avenue is just ahead, its intersection one of the main approaches to the stadium complex. The street was designed for game-day traffic, extra lanes and special signals and all the infrastructure of mass movement.

A police substation occupies the corner, its windows dark, its parking spots empty. The police maintained order during events, managed crowds, directed traffic. The order has been discontinued. The crowds have dispersed. The traffic has stopped.

A memorial plaque on the wall commemorates officers who served. The officers are gone. The plaque remains, honoring service to a public that no longer needs serving.`,
