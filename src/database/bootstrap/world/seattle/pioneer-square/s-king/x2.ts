  description: `The International District's character asserts itself here, even in ruin. The signage shifts to Vietnamese and Chinese characters, faded and weather-beaten but still legible, the storefronts showing the densely-packed arrangement that immigrant retail neighborhoods maintained. The community that built this place is scattered now—those who survived the war dispersed to wherever survivors went.

PHO 88 occupies the corner building, its windows dark, its kitchen cold. Through the grimy glass: tables for four still arranged for service, condiment trays dried and crusted with whatever was in them fifty-five years ago. The pass-through window to the kitchen frames stainless steel equipment rusted brown. The lucky number in the name brought no luck when the war came.

A golden Buddha statue sits in the restaurant's front window, dust-covered but intact, still maintaining its vigil over a business that will never reopen. The iconography of prosperity and protection, watching over nothing. The buildings along this block are uniformly two-story, their scale preserving the neighborhood's historic character even as the neighborhood itself died.`,
