  description: `A social club occupies the second floor of one building, its windows covered with paper, its activities private. The club served the older generation, men who played mahjong and discussed politics and remembered a country they left decades ago. The games have ended. The memories have no one to hold them.

A grocery cart sits abandoned on the sidewalk, its wheels locked, its basket empty. Someone was shopping when shopping stopped mattering. The cart waits to be pushed.

A fire hydrant painted in the colors of the Chinese flag stands at the corner, a small assertion of identity in a city that didn't always welcome it.`,
