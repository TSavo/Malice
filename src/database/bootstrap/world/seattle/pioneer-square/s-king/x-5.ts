  description: `Lumen Field is visible to the south now, the football stadium, home of the Seahawks. The stadium was famous for being loud, the crowd noise reaching levels that registered on seismographs. The noise is gone. The seismographs have nothing to measure.

A team store occupies the ground floor of a building here, its windows full of merchandise in team colors. Jerseys and hats and things that declared allegiance to something bigger than oneself. The allegiance continues, unclaimed.

A bronze statue of a player stands outside the store, frozen in athletic glory. The player retired years ago. The statue was meant to be eternal. It's getting its wish.`,
