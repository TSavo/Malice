  description: `Occidental Avenue intersects S. King Street at the southern terminus of the pedestrian mall, cracked cobblestones ending where asphalt begins. King Street Station is visible to the east, its clock tower—modeled on the campanile of St. Mark's Basilica in Venice—rising above surrounding buildings. The clock stopped at some point in the last fifty-five years. No one has reset it. The station served Amtrak's Cascades corridor and Sounder commuter trains. The trains stopped running when the fuel ran out.

The streetscape transitions here: the intimate scale of Occidental's pedestrian mall giving way to broader streets that stadium traffic once required. The infrastructure shows competing demands that no longer compete—historic preservation and contemporary function both suspended in abandonment.

The buildings at this corner bridge two districts: older structures adapted to serve stadium crowds that scattered decades ago. The ground floors are dark. The restaurants and shops closed when the customers stopped coming.`,
