  description: `Occidental Avenue crosses S. King Street at the southern tip of the pedestrian mall. King Street Station is visible to the east, its clock tower rising above the train sheds, keeping time for trains that no longer run.

The cobblestones of Occidental give way to asphalt here, the careful urban planning of the mall yielding to the practical needs of stadium traffic. The traffic has stopped. The planning seems wasted.

A newsstand occupies the corner, its papers yellowed, its magazines faded. The headlines announced things that mattered then. They don't matter now. Nothing matters now, or everything does, depending on how you look at it.

The intersection is clear. Occidental runs north toward the mall. S. King continues east and west.`,
