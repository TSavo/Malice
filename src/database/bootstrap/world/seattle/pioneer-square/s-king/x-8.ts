  description: `King Street passes through the southern edge of Pioneer Square here, where the neighborhood's Victorian character begins to give way to the more industrial buildings that served the rail yards and port facilities. The transition is gradual—a brick warehouse next to an ornate commercial building, function and form intermingled.

The street surface is cobblestone on this block, one of the few stretches where the original paving survives. The cobbles were laid in the 1890s, hand-set by workers whose names were never recorded. The stones have shifted over the decades, creating an uneven surface that would be charming if it weren't treacherous.

A faded crosswalk marks an intersection with an alley that leads north, the white paint worn to grey ghosts. The alley is dark and narrow, the buildings on either side leaning together overhead.`,
