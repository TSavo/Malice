  description: `T-Mobile Park looms to the south, its retractable roof closed or open, it's hard to tell from here. The Mariners played there, Seattle's baseball team, lovable losers for most of their existence. The losing has stopped. So has the loving.

A sports bar occupies the building here, its walls covered with jerseys and photographs and memorabilia from seasons that happened. The memorabilia is still there. The seasons are over.

A street vendor's cart sits abandoned at the curb, its umbrella torn, its hot dogs long gone. The vendor worked this corner on game days, making more money in a few hours than most people made in a day. The money doesn't matter anymore.`,
