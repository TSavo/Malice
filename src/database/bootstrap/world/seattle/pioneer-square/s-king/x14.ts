  description: `Fourth Avenue intersects S. King Street at the southeastern corner of Pioneer Square's grid—and the end of the line going east. The Chinatown Gate that once spanned King Street lies in ruins, its traditional pagoda-style arch collapsed across the road. Red columns splintered, curved eaves crushed flat, golden characters that declared welcome now half-buried in rubble. The gate was built in the 1970s to announce the community's presence. Now it blocks the way in.

Beyond the fallen gate, King Street is impassable. Debris from the collapse and subsequent damage to adjacent buildings has created a solid wall of wreckage. The International District lies somewhere beyond, but you can't get there from here.

EAST WEST BANK occupies the corner building, its windows dark, its vault presumably still sealed. The bank's signage appears in English, Chinese, and Vietnamese—the multilingual communication fading but legible.

Fourth Avenue continues north from here. King Street continues west. East is a dead end.`,
