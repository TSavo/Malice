Exercise equipment lines one wall, stationary bikes and treadmills that went nowhere even when they were being used. They still go nowhere. The going is the same.

A bulletin board inside lists events and services in multiple Asian languages. The events have been cancelled. The services have been discontinued. The languages persist, untranslated.`,
