  description: `Benches line the northern edge of the park here, facing south toward the plaza's interior, their backs to S. Washington Street. The benches are memorial donations, each with a small brass plaque on the backrest: "In loving memory of..." Names and dates. People remembered by people who are themselves now forgotten or dead.

One plaque has been scratched through, deliberate vandalism that obliterated whatever name was there. Someone was angry at the dead person, or angry at death itself, or just angry. The scratch marks are deep, made with a key or knife, the violence of the gesture preserved in metal.

S. Washington Street is visible beyond the park's northern edge, Victorian buildings rising dark and silent. The Grand Central Building's corner is visible to the northwest, its distinctive clock tower—modeled after Big Ben—showing a time that stopped when the power failed. The clock was always a few minutes fast. Now it's years behind.`,
