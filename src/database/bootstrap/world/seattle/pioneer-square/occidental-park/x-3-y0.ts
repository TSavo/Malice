  description: `A chain-link fence sags across this section of the park, an old construction barrier that was never removed—or perhaps installed after the Event to keep something out or in. The posts lean at angles, the fabric rusted through in places, whatever it once protected or contained long since irrelevant. The fence creates a corridor of sorts, channeling movement through the plaza in ways the original designers never intended.

The brick paving is heaved here, frost damage accumulating over fifty-five winters without repair. Weeds push through the joints, hardy urban plants that found purchase in the cracks. A shopping cart rusted to lace sits abandoned near the fence, its metal reduced to almost nothing by oxidation.

S. Main Street is visible to the south through gaps in the surrounding buildings. The sound of wind across brick is the only sound, a low whisper that the plaza's geometry amplifies and distorts.`,
