// Occidental Park - eastern plaza

  description: `Dead trees line the park's eastern boundary here, their trunks creating a permeable wall between plaza and the alley-like space that runs along 2nd Avenue. The trees were planted to define the edge without blocking it—a design choice that acknowledged people's desire to see through barriers even while accepting them.

The space between the trees frames views of the buildings beyond—glimpses of fire escapes and loading docks and the service infrastructure that Pioneer Square's commercial facades concealed. The back-of-house revealed, the careful stage management of urban retail exposed.

A cat slinks between the dead trees, a tabby with torn ears and a wary posture. Feral, probably, or just adapted to the absence of people who would once have chased it away. The cat pauses to watch you, assessing threat or opportunity, then continues on its patrol. Life persists, even here.`,
