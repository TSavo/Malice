  description: `A metal hatch is set into the brick paving here, flush with the surface, marked with the symbol ⊕—the old Underground Seattle access point. The hatch is locked, its padlock rusted solid, but the frame shows marks where someone tried to pry it open. The Underground tours ended decades ago, but whatever lies beneath—the buried streets, the sealed storefronts, the original Seattle entombed when the city raised itself after the Great Fire—remains.

The hatch is cold to the touch. Air moves through gaps in the seal, carrying the smell of damp earth and old brick, the exhalation of a buried city. The Underground extends beneath most of Pioneer Square, a parallel world preserved in darkness. Whatever lived down there when people stopped tending it... that's a different question.

The brick plaza stretches away in all directions, sun-faded and cracked. But here at the hatch, you're standing on a threshold between worlds.`,
