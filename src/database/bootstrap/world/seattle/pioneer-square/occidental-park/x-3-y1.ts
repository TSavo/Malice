  description: `An information kiosk stands at an angle here, knocked from its foundation by something—impact or earthquake or fifty-five years of Seattle wind. The glass panels are shattered, the maps inside faded to illegibility, the tourist information serving no tourists. "PIONEER SQUARE HISTORIC DISTRICT" reads the header, the text beneath it a blur of water damage and UV decay. The district is still historic. More historic now than ever.

This was the heart of the pedestrian mall when people still gathered here. The brick herringbone pattern underfoot is worn smooth in places where foot traffic concentrated—the paths people took without thinking, the desire lines made physical. Those paths lead nowhere now. The desire has gone elsewhere.

A dead maple stands nearby, its trunk hollow, its bark peeling in sheets. Birds nested in the hollow once. The nest is visible through a gap in the wood, abandoned like everything else.`,
