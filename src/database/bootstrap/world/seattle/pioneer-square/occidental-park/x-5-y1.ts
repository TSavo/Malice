  description: `The park's eastern edge approaches here, the enclosed feeling of the plaza giving way to the more open streetscape of 2nd Avenue beyond. The transition is marked by a change in ground level—three shallow steps down to the sidewalk, the brick giving way to concrete.

A bicycle rack stands near the steps, the old-fashioned kind with loops of metal pipe. Three bicycles are still locked to it, their frames rusted, their tires flat and rotted, their locks seized solid. The owners never came back for them. The bicycles wait with the patience of objects, indifferent to the passage of time.

One bicycle was expensive once—you can tell by the frame geometry, the remnants of what was quality hardware. Someone's commuter bike, locked here on a day that turned out to be their last day at work. The lock is still engaged. The key is somewhere else, perhaps with bones, perhaps in a drawer in an empty apartment.`,
