  description: `A solitary bench faces west here, oriented toward the park's center, its back to the buildings along 2nd Avenue. The positioning is protective—you can sit here with solid wall behind you, watching the open plaza without being watched from behind. A defensive posture. Someone understood that parks could feel threatening as well as welcoming.

The bench's wooden slats are weathered silver-grey, smooth from years of use before the use stopped. Someone carved something into one slat—not initials, but what looks like a chess notation. E4, the King's Pawn opening. A game that was never finished, recorded in wood.

From this bench, you can see most of the park's eastern half—the dead trees, the sculptures, the pergola to the northwest. It's a good vantage point. You can see anyone approaching long before they reach you. In a dead city, that matters. It matters more than whoever carved it knew.`,
