  description: `A diagonal pathway cuts across the plaza here, its basket-weave brick pattern contrasting with the surrounding herringbone. The path was added later, a concession to the way people actually walked rather than the way designers wanted them to. Desire lines made permanent.

The bricks along the path are more worn than those around it, polished smooth by feet that no longer walk here. The contrast reveals how heavily trafficked this route was—office workers cutting through on lunch breaks, commuters shortening their walks home, the accumulated friction of thousands of passages.

A storm drain grate is set into the path, its metal bars clogged with leaves and debris that have accumulated over seasons. Water pools here when it rains, the drain no longer draining, creating a puddle that freezes and thaws and freezes again. The puddle reflects sky and dead trees and the buildings beyond.`,
