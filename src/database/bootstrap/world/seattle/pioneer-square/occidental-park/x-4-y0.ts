  description: `The southwestern corner of Occidental Park, where the brick plaza meets S. Main Street to the south. The park was created in the 1970s by closing off Occidental Avenue to vehicle traffic, converting the street into a pedestrian plaza. That experiment in urban design succeeded until the Event made all experiments irrelevant.

The plaza here is paved with red brick in a herringbone pattern, the bricks weathered but mostly intact. A low concrete barrier separates the park from S. Main Street, more suggestion than fence, easy to step over.

A dead tree stands near the corner, its bark grey and peeling, its branches bare of leaves. The tree has been dead for months, maybe longer, but it still stands, rooted in a small square of soil cut into the brick plaza. Someone planted it with hope. The hope is gone but the tree remains.

A bench faces south toward the street, its wooden slats weathered silver-grey, its metal frame showing rust at the joints. The bench is empty. All the benches are empty.

The park extends north and east from here.`,
