  description: `A wooden bench faces west here, oriented toward the Underground access hatch visible across the plaza. The positioning seems deliberate—as if someone once sat here watching that entrance, waiting to see who came up from below or went down into darkness. The bench is weathered silver-grey, its slats warped by seasons of rain and sun.

Carved initials mark one armrest, the cuts deepened by weather: "M + J" inside a heart, the kind of mark that lovers made everywhere once. M and J are probably dead now. Or scattered. Or simply elsewhere, their love a casualty of whatever happened to everyone else. The heart persists, outlasting the emotion that carved it.

S. Main Street is visible to the south, the storefronts along its edge dark and shuttered. The Underground hatch to the west gleams dully in whatever light filters through the overcast. This is a good place to sit and watch. There's just nothing left to watch for.`,
