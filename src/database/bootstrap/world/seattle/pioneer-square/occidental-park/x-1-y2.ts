  description: `The brick paving shows wear patterns here, the paths of ten thousand daily passages worn smooth while the surrounding brick retains its texture. You can read the ghost of old traffic in the surface—the diagonal shortcut office workers took, the arc around the performance stage, the straight line from the coffee shop on Main to the office tower on Washington. Desire lines, the urban planners called them. The desires are gone. The lines remain.

A commemorative brick is set into the plaza here, one of hundreds sold to raise funds in some long-forgotten campaign. "IN MEMORY OF DAVID CHEN, WHO LOVED THIS PLACE." The brass letters are oxidized green. David Chen is dead now, one way or another. His love for this place outlasted him, outlasted the place itself as a living thing.

The wind shifts, carrying the smell of salt from the bay mixed with the musty scent of decaying leaves. The plaza is exposed here, nothing to break the weather that sweeps in off Elliott Bay.`,
