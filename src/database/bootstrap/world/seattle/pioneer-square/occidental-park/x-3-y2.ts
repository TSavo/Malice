  description: `A brick planter box rises from the plaza here, waist-high, its original plantings dead and reduced to brittle sticks. But something else grows there now—a scraggly volunteer, some wind-seeded sapling that found purchase in the neglected soil. The tree is small and struggling, bent by wind, but alive. Green leaves. Actual green leaves, the first living plant you've seen in blocks.

Life persists. That's what the sapling says. Fifty-five years of abandonment and something still reaches for the sky, still converts sunlight to sugar, still grows. The contrast with the dead trees surrounding the plaza is stark—those were cultivated, watered, cared for. This one survives on nothing but rain and whatever nutrients leach from the decaying brick.

The buildings ringing the park loom dark and empty, their windows reflecting grey sky. The sapling doesn't care about the buildings. It just grows.`,
