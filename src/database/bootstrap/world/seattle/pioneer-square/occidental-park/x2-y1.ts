// Occidental Park - eastern edge

  description: `The park's eastern edge meets the alley-like space along 2nd Avenue here, the brick paving ending abruptly at asphalt. The contrast is deliberate—the designers wanted you to know when you'd left the pedestrian realm and entered the vehicular one. The vehicles are gone now, but the boundary persists.

A fire hydrant stands at the edge, painted the municipal red that Seattle used, its paint faded to rust-pink. The hydrant is buried to its coupling in debris—leaves and paper and urban detritus accumulated around its base, making it look like something emerging from the ground rather than installed on it.

The buildings along 2nd Avenue rise beyond the park's edge, their facades showing the loading docks and service entrances that front on this side. The back of things. The infrastructure that kept the front running. The back and front are equally abandoned now, the distinction meaningless.`,
