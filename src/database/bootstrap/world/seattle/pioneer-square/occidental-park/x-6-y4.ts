  description: `The northwestern corner of Occidental Park, where the plaza meets S. Washington Street to the north. The park's brick paving continues to the low concrete barrier that marks the boundary with the street.

A totem pole stands near this corner, carved from a single cedar log, rising seven meters into the air. The pole was installed in the 1970s, a nod to Pacific Northwest indigenous art, though its presence here—far from its cultural context—was always complicated. The figures carved into the pole—raven, bear, whale—stare out over the empty plaza with painted eyes.

The pole's paint has weathered, colors fading to ghost versions of their original brightness. Rain has darkened the wood where water runs down from the carved protrusions. Moss has begun to grow in the deeper carved spaces, finding purchase in the texture.

A bench sits near the pole, oriented to face it, positioned so someone could sit and contemplate the carving. The bench is empty. The pole is still worth contemplating, but there's no one to do it.

The park extends south and east from here.`,
