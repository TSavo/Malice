  description: `Occidental Park spreads out here, its brick plaza eastern plaza. The park was created in the 1970s by closing Occidental Avenue to traffic, converting asphalt to pedestrian space. The brick paving in herringbone pattern stretches in all directions, weathered but intact.

Dead trees line this edge, creating a natural fence between park and the alley-like space beyond. The detail speaks to a time when the park was maintained, when someone cared about these spaces and the people who used them.

Dead trees punctuate the plaza at intervals, their bare branches creating stark silhouettes. They were planted with intention, part of an urban design that valued green space and shade. The trees are dead now but still standing, monuments to earlier optimism.

The brick plaza continues in all accessible directions, open to sky and weather.`,
