  description: `The western edge of Occidental Park, where the brick plaza meets the buildings that line First Avenue to the west. The park stretches east from here, opening into the broader plaza space.

A metal sculpture stands near the edge, an abstract piece from the 1980s—welded steel painted in colors that have faded and chipped away. The sculpture represents something. Movement, maybe. Energy. Connection. The artist had an intention. The sculpture remains, silent and rusting.

Dead trees line this edge of the park at intervals, their trunks still upright, their branches creating stark patterns against the sky. They were London Plane trees once, chosen for their tolerance of urban conditions. They tolerated everything until they couldn't anymore.

A wooden bench faces east toward the center of the park. Its slats are weathered, one cracked through the middle, the break revealing wood grain patterns like frozen water. Nobody has sat here in a long time.

The park extends north, east, and south.`,
