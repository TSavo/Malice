  description: `A concrete planter dominates this section of the plaza, hexagonal, waist-high, containing a dead cherry tree that was once the centerpiece of the park's spring display. The tree's bark has gone silver-grey, its branches bare, but you can still see the buds that never opened—tiny knots along each twig, frozen in potential.

Cherry blossoms drew crowds here in April. The tree was Japanese, a gift from Seattle's sister city, planted with ceremony and maintained with care. People photographed themselves beneath its branches, petals falling like pink snow. The tree was beautiful. Now it's a monument to what beauty once meant here.

The soil in the planter has shrunk away from the concrete edges, cracked and dry despite Seattle's rain. A drainage problem, perhaps, or just the accumulated damage of fifty-five years without care. The tree died slowly. Some things do.`,
