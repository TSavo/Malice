  description: `A metal sculpture rises from the brick here, abstract forms welded into something that suggests motion or growth or perhaps the explosion of a seed pod. The sculpture was installed in the 1990s, part of the city's public art program. A small plaque at its base names the artist and explains the piece's meaning. The explanation involves phrases like "urban renewal" and "community vitality." The irony is too obvious to comment on.

The sculpture has weathered interestingly—rust creating orange streaks down the steel, moss colonizing the joints, a patina that the artist never intended but that adds to the piece's character. Decay as collaboration. The sculpture is more beautiful now than when it was new, if beauty means anything in an empty plaza.

A pigeon has built a nest in the sculpture's upper reaches, sticks and debris wedged into a hollow the welding created. The nest appears abandoned, but pigeons are survivors. It might be occupied again come spring.`,
