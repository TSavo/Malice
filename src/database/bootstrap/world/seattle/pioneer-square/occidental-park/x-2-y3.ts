  description: `A row of dead maples creates a colonnade through this section of the park, their trunks aligned with military precision, their spacing calculated to maximize shade while maintaining sightlines. The urban foresters who planted them understood both biology and sociology—trees that welcomed without concealing, shade that cooled without hiding.

The trees are dead now, but they still define the space. Their trunks mark rhythm, their branches create patterns of shadow even without leaves. Walking between them feels ceremonial, a procession through a space designed for movement. The destination was always the center of the park. The center is empty now, but the procession continues for anyone willing to walk it.

One tree has begun to lean, its root system compromised by decades of drought and freeze cycles. The lean is perhaps ten degrees off vertical. In another decade, it will fall. In another century, it will have rotted into the brick. Time moves at its own pace.`,
