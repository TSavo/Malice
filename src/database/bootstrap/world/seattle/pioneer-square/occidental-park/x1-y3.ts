  description: `The northeastern corner of the park approaches S. Washington Street, the brick plaza ending at a low concrete curb. A drinking fountain stands here, one of the old cast-iron models with a foot pedal and an arcing spout. The fountain is dry, its basin stained with mineral deposits, its mechanism seized by corrosion. Someone scratched words into the basin's rim—"STILL WAITING"—the letters crude but legible.

The fountain was a gathering point once. People met here, filled water bottles, let dogs drink from cupped hands. The basin is cracked now, a freeze-thaw fracture running through the cast iron. Even if water flowed, it would leak away.

S. Washington Street stretches away to the east and west, Victorian storefronts dark on both sides. The intersection with 2nd Avenue is visible nearby, the traffic signals hanging dark and useless over pavement that hasn't seen a car in fifty-five years.`,
