  description: `The northern edge of the park approaches S. Washington Street, the brick giving way to concrete curbing. A trash receptacle stands here, its green municipal paint flaked away to reveal rusted steel beneath. The basket inside has corroded through, whatever garbage it once held long since scattered by wind or scavengers. The receptacle still stands at attention, waiting for trash that will never come.

Graffiti covers a nearby utility box—layers of tags accumulating over decades, the oldest ones barely visible beneath newer marks. Someone painted "2055" in silver, the year they made their mark. Someone else crossed it out and wrote "GONE" in red. Both statements are equally true now. The year is gone. Everything is gone.

S. Washington Street is visible to the north, the Victorian buildings beyond it dark and silent. The totem pole in the park's northwest corner is visible from here, its carved figures watching over emptiness.`,
