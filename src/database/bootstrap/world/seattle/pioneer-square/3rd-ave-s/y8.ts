  description: `The Corp Construction zone dominates both sides of the avenue here, its fences running parallel, creating a channel of public space between private mysteries. The black fabric covering the fences blocks any view of what lies beyond. The fabric is newer here, less weathered, replaced more recently than elsewhere.

Guard booths stand at intervals along the fence, their windows dark, their doors sealed. The guards left when the paychecks stopped. The booths remain, checkpoints for a workforce that no longer arrives.

A porta-potty row sits against the eastern fence, the blue plastic units still standing in formation. The smell has faded with time. Whatever biological processes occurred inside have long since completed.

The avenue is quiet. The construction zone is quieter. Nothing moves behind those fences. Nothing has moved there in a long time.`,
