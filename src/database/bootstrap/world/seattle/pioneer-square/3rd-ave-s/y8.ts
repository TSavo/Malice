  description: `The wrapped building ends here, its southern corner marked by a gap in the black fabric where someone cut through. The cut is precise, surgical almost, made by someone who knew what they were doing. The chain-link behind it has been bent back, creating an opening just large enough for a person to slip through.

No one is visible inside. The darkness beyond the gap is absolute. Whatever is in there, it's not lit from within.

Across the avenue, the Corp Construction zone fence begins, standard construction barriers topped with barbed wire. Signs warn of authorized personnel only. The authorization system is probably still in some database somewhere, still checking credentials that no longer matter.

The avenue narrows here, the wrapped building on one side and the construction fence on the other creating a corridor effect. It feels like being watched.`,
