  description: `South of Jackson, Third Avenue enters the commercial heart of the International District. The buildings here are older, built by the first generation of immigrants who made this place their own. They built to last. They built well. The buildings remain when everything else has failed.

A Chinese bakery occupies the corner, its window display still showing plastic replicas of mooncakes and egg tarts and the sweet buns that fueled a community's mornings. The glass cases inside are empty. The replicas remain, promises of sweetness that cannot be kept.

A family association building rises on the western side, its facade decorated with Chinese characters announcing which clan called this place home. The associations bound families together, provided support and connection and belonging. The families have scattered. The associations persist in stone.

The district continues south, its character deepening with each block.`,
