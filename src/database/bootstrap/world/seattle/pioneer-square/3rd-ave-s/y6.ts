  description: `The Collapsed Building's debris field begins to encroach from the east here, rubble spilling past the Corp Construction fence and onto the avenue. Someone tried to clear a path—the debris shows signs of being moved—but the effort was abandoned. The pile was too large. The machinery too precious. The will too fragile.

A crane arm extends from the rubble, its yellow paint visible beneath concrete dust. The crane was on top of the building when it fell, or maybe it fell with the building. The physics of collapse don't discriminate between structure and machine.

The Corp Construction fence on the western side is intact here, its black fabric pristine, its warning signs stern. "HARD HAT AREA." "NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY." "VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED." The prosecution system has collapsed more thoroughly than the building.

Washington Street is visible to the south, marking the edge of the debris field.`,
