  description: `A warehouse dominates the eastern side of the avenue, its corrugated metal walls rusted but intact. The building was designed to be temporary, a prefab structure meant to serve for a decade or two until something permanent could be built. Sixty years later, nothing permanent was ever built. The temporary became eternal through neglect.

Loading bays line the warehouse's street face, their roll-up doors in various states of failure—some open, some closed, some frozen at odd angles. Whatever the warehouse held was cleaned out long ago, scavenged in waves by people who needed anything they could find. The interior is empty now, echoing and dark.

The street surface here is concrete rather than asphalt, heavy-duty paving designed for truck traffic. The concrete has cracked but not crumbled, more durable than the asphalt elsewhere. Even the infrastructure here was built for function over form.`,
