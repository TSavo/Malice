  description: `Third Avenue runs east of the Corp Construction site here, the black barrier visible to the west blocking whatever lies beyond. The construction—if that's what it is—has been ongoing for years without visible progress. Whatever they're doing in there, they're doing it slowly and quietly.

The eastern side of the avenue offers a view into open lots where buildings have been cleared. The demolition looks intentional rather than catastrophic—foundations remain, pipes and conduits capped and sealed, the kind of careful teardown that precedes rebuilding. The rebuilding never came.

Wild grasses have colonized the empty lots, growing waist-high in summer before winter knocks them down. The cycle has repeated enough times that thick mats of dead vegetation carpet the ground, slowly becoming soil. Nature doesn't wait for permits.`,
