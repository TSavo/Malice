  description: `The Corp Construction zone continues along the western side of the avenue, uninterrupted, unchanging. Whatever they were building in there, they were building a lot of it. The zone extends for blocks, consuming what used to be parking lots and low-rise buildings and the accumulated clutter of urban commerce.

The eastern side opens up here, the Collapsed Building's shadow receding, replaced by a surface parking lot that became a staging area for rescue operations. Orange cones still mark lanes. Portable lights still stand on their tripods, batteries long dead. The rescuers found what they were going to find and moved on. The staging area remains, ready for emergencies that have already happened.

A food truck sits in the lot, its serving window closed, its menu board still advertising tacos and burritos. The truck fed the rescue workers. Now it feeds no one. The propane tanks are probably still full.

The avenue continues, bordered by mystery and abandonment.`,
