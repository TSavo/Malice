// 3rd Ave S - between S. Jackson St and S. King St

  name: '3rd Ave S',
  description: `The southern edge of the International District proper, where the neighborhood begins to yield to the industrial zones and transit infrastructure that surround it. The buildings here are newer, less ornate, built for function rather than community. The character is different but the emptiness is the same.

A transit station entrance descends into the earth, its escalators frozen, its fare gates stuck open. The station connected the district to the rest of the city, brought workers and visitors and the daily commerce of urban life. The connections have been severed. The station waits underground.

A phone store occupies the corner, its window displaying devices that once connected everyone to everything. The displays are dusty. The phones are dead. The connections they promised have proven fragile.

King Street is visible to the south, marking the boundary, the edge, the end of this particular grid of streets and meaning.`,
