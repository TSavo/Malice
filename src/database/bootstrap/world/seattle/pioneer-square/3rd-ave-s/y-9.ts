  description: `Third Avenue runs along the eastern edge of Pioneer Square proper, where the historic district gives way to the infrastructure that supported it—parking lots, loading docks, the unglamorous necessities of urban commerce. The glamour, such as it was, concentrated further west. This was always the back door.

The buildings here are utilitarian: concrete and cinder block, flat roofs and minimal ornament. They were built for function in the 1950s and 60s, when no one thought function needed defending. The lack of ornament has become its own aesthetic in the ruin—honest decay rather than pretentious decay.

A chain-link fence surrounds an empty lot where a building once stood. The demolition happened before the end—urban renewal, probably, the kind that cleared blight to create parking. The parking lot is cracked and overgrown now. The blight returned in a different form.`,
