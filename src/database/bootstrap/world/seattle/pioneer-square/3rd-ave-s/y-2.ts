  description: `South of Main, Third Avenue enters the transition zone between Pioneer Square and the International District. The architecture shifts, the massive courthouse giving way to smaller buildings with more varied facades. The Corp Construction zone is behind now, its mysteries contained to the north.

A bail bonds office occupies the corner, its neon sign still glowing fitfully—someone's solar setup keeping the promise of freedom alive. "24 HOUR SERVICE" the sign claims. The service has been suspended. The sign keeps advertising.

Across the avenue, a law office displays its shingle: immigration services, family law, personal injury. The lawyers served the community. The community has dispersed. The shingle swings in the wind, creaking on its chains.

A bus shelter offers minimal protection from elements that don't care about shelters. The schedule inside shows routes to places that exist only in memory.`,
