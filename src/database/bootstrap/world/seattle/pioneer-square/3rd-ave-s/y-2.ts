  description: `The International District asserts itself more strongly here. Signs in Chinese and Vietnamese and Korean compete for attention on storefronts built for immigrant entrepreneurs who came to America seeking opportunity. The opportunity has changed shape. The signs remain.

A travel agency window displays posters of destinations that might as well be other planets. Vietnam. China. Thailand. The beaches and temples and city skylines of places that exist somewhere across oceans that no one crosses anymore.

A money transfer service occupies the corner, its wire transfer rates still posted in the window. The wires are down. The rates are academic. The money that flowed through here to support families overseas has stopped flowing.

The avenue continues south toward Jackson Street, where the district's heart beats—or used to beat.`,
