// 3rd Ave S - approaching Yesler Way

  name: '3rd Ave S',
  description: `Yesler Way cuts across Third Avenue just ahead, the diagonal intersection where street grids collide. The flooded crater that blocks the intersection is visible from here—the light rail tunnel collapse that left a water-filled depression where the street should be. The water is dark and still, reflecting nothing.

Buildings on both sides of the avenue show damage from whatever caused the collapse—windows blown out in a radial pattern, facades cracked and spalling, the structural wounds of explosive decompression. The tunnel must have held pressure when it flooded, then released it all at once. The buildings remember what the water has hidden.

Third Avenue ends here, at least for practical purposes. The route continues on paper, but the flooded crater makes passage impossible without swimming through water of unknown depth and uncertain contents. No one swims it.`,
