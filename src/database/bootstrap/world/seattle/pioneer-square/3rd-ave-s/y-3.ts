  description: `Hing Hay Park is visible to the east, its pagoda pavilion rising above the surrounding rooftops. The park was the heart of the International District, a gathering place for tai chi and gossip and the slow accumulation of community. The tai chi practitioners are gone. The gossip has stopped. The community has scattered.

A Chinese grocery store occupies the western corner, its windows still displaying the plastic grass mats and ceramic lucky cats that signaled authenticity to tourists and familiarity to residents. The produce section is dark, its refrigeration silent, its vegetables returned to earth in their own way.

A red paper lantern hangs from a fire escape above, somehow surviving the months of weather. Its color has faded to pink, but it still sways in the breeze, still marking this as a place where celebration once happened.

Jackson Street is visible to the south, the district's main artery.`,
