  description: `The stadiums loom to the west, visible over the rooftops—the baseball stadium with its retractable roof, the football stadium with its exposed steel and dramatic angles. They built the stadiums here because the land was cheap and the neighborhood had no political power to resist. The neighborhood adapted, as it always had.

A sports bar occupies the corner, its windows plastered with team logos and pennants from championships that seemed important once. The TVs inside are dark. The kegs are dry. The jerseys on the walls commemorate victories that no one celebrates anymore.

Across the avenue, a senior housing complex rises, its balconies decorated with plants that have either thrived or died depending on their water needs. The seniors who lived here were the last generation to remember what the neighborhood was before the stadiums, before the light rail, before everything. They remembered and they stayed. They're not here now.

King Street approaches from the south.`,
