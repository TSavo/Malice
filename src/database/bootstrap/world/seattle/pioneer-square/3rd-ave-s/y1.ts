  description: `The Corp Construction zone ends here, its fence turning east along Main Street. A gate marks the corner, double-wide, meant for vehicle access. The gate is locked with multiple padlocks, chains wrapped through the bars in patterns that suggest paranoia or thoroughness or both.

The courthouse steps rise across the avenue, granite worn smooth by generations of defendants and lawyers and witnesses and everyone else who passed through the justice system. The steps lead to bronze doors that stand slightly ajar. Someone went inside. Whether they came out is unknown.

A statue stands at the base of the steps, a robed figure holding scales. The scales are balanced. They were always balanced. That was the promise. The statue's bronze has gone green with verdigris, giving the figure a sickly pallor.

Main Street stretches east and west, empty and wide.`,
