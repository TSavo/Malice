  description: `The collapsed building's rubble pile is visible to the east, a mountain of brick and concrete that once was a seven-story structure. The collapse happened during the burning—whether from direct strike, fire damage, or just accumulated neglect finally giving way. The rubble has been here long enough that vegetation grows from the pile, hardy shrubs finding purchase in the destruction.

Third Avenue passes close to the debris field here, the street narrowed by rubble that spilled beyond the building's original footprint. A cleared path keeps the route passable, the debris pushed aside by someone at some point to maintain passage. The maintenance was minimal—just enough to walk through, not enough to call it clean.

The smell of old fire lingers, decades of rain unable to wash away completely the char and ash that permeated the rubble. On hot days, the smell intensifies, released by sun-warmed concrete.`,
