  description: `Third Avenue dead-ends here at a wall of rubble. The collapsed building's debris has completely buried the road to the south—a two-story mountain of brick, concrete, and twisted steel blocking all passage toward Washington Street. The seven-story structure pancaked during the burning and spread outward, swallowing this entire stretch of Third Avenue.

To reach Washington or points south, you'll have to go around via Yesler Way and take 4th Avenue down. The detour adds blocks to any journey, but the alternative is climbing gear and questionable life choices.

The smell of old fire lingers in the debris, decades of rain unable to wash away completely the char and ash that permeated the rubble. Hardy shrubs have found purchase in the destruction, green life emerging from the grave of the building. Yesler Way lies just ahead to the north, still passable.`,
