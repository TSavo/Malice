  description: `The flooded crater from the tunnel collapse is just to the north, its edge marked by broken pavement and warning signs that nobody put up officially. Someone spray-painted "DEEP" on a chunk of concrete. Someone else added "WATER." Both are understatements.

The wrapped building on the corner extends down this block, its chain-link and black fabric barrier continuing along the avenue. Whatever they were hiding in there, they were serious about it. The fabric has torn in places, but the glimpses reveal only darkness. No structure visible. No equipment. Just void.

Security cameras on poles still point inward, toward whatever the fabric conceals. Their power source must be internal. Their red recording lights are dark, but the cameras themselves seem intact. Watching nothing. Recording nothing. Waiting.

The Corp Construction zone begins to the south, its fences newer, its purpose equally unclear.`,
