  description: `A Vietnamese community center occupies the eastern side of the avenue, its bulletin boards still covered with announcements for events that never happened. English classes. Citizenship ceremonies. Lunar New Year celebrations. The announcements have yellowed. The thumbtacks have rusted. The community has dispersed to wherever communities go when cities fail.

Across the avenue, a Buddhist supply store displays statues and incense and the material goods of spiritual practice. A golden Buddha sits in the window, serene and unchanging, radiating calm into an empty street. The calm persists. The street does not argue with it.

Someone has left offerings at the store's doorstep—oranges and flowers and joss paper. The offerings are recent. Someone still believes. Someone still hopes. The oranges are fresh.

The avenue continues toward King Street, the southern boundary of the district.`,
