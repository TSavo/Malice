  description: `The condemned block's eastern edge meets Third Avenue here, marked by warning signs and remnants of barricades. The contamination that rendered those buildings uninhabitable—chemical spill, bioweapon residue, the stories vary—supposedly doesn't extend this far. Supposedly. People still give the area a wide berth.

The smell is faint but present, something chemical beneath the ordinary urban decay. Whether it's imagination or actual contamination is hard to say. The body responds to warnings even when the mind questions them.

On the western side, buildings that should have been demolished stand empty and waiting. Their windows are boarded, their doors sealed with official notices that lost their authority decades ago. The seals are mostly intact. People have learned to respect boundaries marked with warnings, even when the warners are gone.`,
