  description: `The Corp Construction fence shows signs of breach here. Someone cut through the chain-link, and someone else patched it with zip ties, and someone after that cut through again. The cycle of intrusion and repair has left the fence looking like a surgical patient, held together by improvised sutures.

What did they find inside? The people who got through aren't talking. The people who patched it aren't around. The mystery persists, layered with the evidence of repeated violation.

Across the avenue, the King County Administration building rises, a brutalist tower of concrete and purpose. The county administered things from here—property records, business licenses, the bureaucratic machinery of civilization. The machinery has stopped. The records remain, filed in cabinets that no one will ever open again.

A hot dog cart sits at the curb, its umbrella faded, its condiment bottles empty. The hot dog vendor served the courthouse workers. The workers are gone. The cart remains.`,
