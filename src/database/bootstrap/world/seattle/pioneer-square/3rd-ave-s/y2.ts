  description: `The King County Courthouse annex occupies the eastern side of the avenue, a newer building connected to the main courthouse by a skybridge. The skybridge is intact, its glass walls offering glimpses of the interior—empty corridors, abandoned security checkpoints, the infrastructure of justice suspended in amber.

The Corp Construction fence continues west, but here it's been decorated. Someone hung photographs on the chain-link, pictures of people. Missing persons flyers, maybe, or memorials. The rain has faded them to ghosts, faces barely visible, names illegible. The fence has become a wall of the forgotten.

A newspaper box stands at the corner, still holding copies of the Seattle Times from months ago. The headline announces something that seemed important then. The newsprint has yellowed. The importance has evaporated.

The courthouse steps are visible to the south, leading up to doors that dispense nothing.`,
