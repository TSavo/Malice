  description: `Third Avenue passes through what was once a transitional zone between neighborhoods—not quite Pioneer Square, not quite the International District, claimed by neither and serving both. The buildings reflect this ambiguity, a mix of styles and eras that never cohered into a distinct identity.

A former bus shelter stands at the curb, its Plexiglas panels cracked and yellowed, its bench long since removed or stolen. The shelter's route map is still mounted inside, showing lines and stops that haven't operated in decades. The 14 bus once ran this route. The 14 bus is a memory now, if anyone remembers.

Graffiti covers the lower stories of buildings on both sides—tags and murals layered over decades, a compressed timeline of urban expression. The oldest tags are almost illegible, faded to shadows. The newest are still sharp, proof that someone still cares enough to make their mark.`,
