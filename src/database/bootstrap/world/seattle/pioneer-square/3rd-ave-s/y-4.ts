  description: `The approach to Jackson Street brings a density of commerce, storefronts packed tightly together, each one offering something the community needed. Herbalists and jewelers and noodle shops and import stores, the ecosystem of an immigrant neighborhood compressed into a few blocks.

A fortune teller's shop displays a faded sign promising insights into the future. The future turned out differently than anyone predicted. The fortune teller didn't see it coming either.

Across the avenue, a dim sum restaurant's window is filled with vintage photographs—the district in the 1920s, in the 1950s, in the 1980s. The photographs show change and persistence, the neighborhood adapting and surviving. It survived exclusion acts and internment and urban renewal and gentrification. It survived everything until it didn't.

The pagoda gates of Jackson Street are visible to the south, marking the ceremonial entrance to Chinatown.`,
