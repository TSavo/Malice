// 3rd Ave S - between S. Jackson and S. Main

  description: `Main Street approaches from the north, the intersection visible ahead where Third Avenue crosses one of Pioneer Square's primary axes. The buildings near the intersection are taller, more ambitious—six and seven stories where the surrounding blocks are three and four. Proximity to Main Street meant higher rents once. The rents stopped mattering. The height remains.

A painted crosswalk is still visible on the asphalt, white stripes faded to grey, showing where pedestrians were meant to cross. The paint predates the end by years, maybe decades—maintained by city crews who no longer exist, following routines that no longer matter.

Newspaper boxes cluster at the corner, their windows showing headlines from the last days of print media. The papers inside have yellowed and decomposed into illegible mulch. The headlines were probably about the end. They always are, at the end.`,
