  description: `The avenue runs north from S. King Street, leaving behind the stadium district and entering the older fabric of Pioneer Square. The buildings here predate the stadiums, brick structures that watched the neighborhood change around them.

A loading dock occupies one building's ground floor, its roll-up door half-open, its interior dark. Trucks backed up here to deliver things. The deliveries have stopped. The dock waits, patient and empty.

A fire escape zigzags down the building across the street, its iron steps rusted but solid. Someone has left a chair on one of the landings, a place to sit and watch a street that no longer needs watching.`,
