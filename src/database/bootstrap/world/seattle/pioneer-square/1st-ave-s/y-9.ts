  description: `First Avenue narrows here between brick warehouses that predate the stadiums by half a century. Their loading docks gape at street level, roll-up doors frozen at various heights like mouths caught mid-sentence. A forklift rusts on one dock, its forks still raised, holding nothing.

The eastern wall of one warehouse has become an archaeology of advertising: ghost signs for flour and coffee and shipping companies, layered over decades, the oldest ones bleeding through where rain has worn the paint. OLYMPIC FLOUR. CARNATION MILK. Names from a Seattle that existed before anyone alive was born.

Across the street, a fire escape descends in sharp zigzags, each landing collecting its own ecosystem of dead leaves and bird droppings. A folding chair sits on the third landing, positioned to face the street. The seat has rusted through. Whoever sat there isn't sitting anymore.`,
