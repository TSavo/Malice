  description: `S. Jackson Street is just ahead, its intersection marking passage into the International District to the east. The boundary between neighborhoods is visible here, Pioneer Square giving way to something with different languages and different histories.

A liquor store occupies the corner, its windows covered with advertisements for brands that promised happiness in a bottle. The bottles are still inside, their happiness unclaimed. The advertisements continue their promises.

A shopping cart has been abandoned against the wall, filled with plastic bags and blankets and the careful accumulation of survival. The owner is gone. The accumulation remains.`,
