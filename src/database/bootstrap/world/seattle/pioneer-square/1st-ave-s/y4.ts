  description: `S. Washington Street is just ahead, its intersection marking the northern edge of Pioneer Square's commercial core. The buildings beyond are more residential, apartments and lofts converted from warehouses.

A vintage clothing store occupies the corner, its window mannequins dressed in styles from decades that seem ancient now. The mannequins pose with eternal patience. The styles will never come back in fashion. Fashion has been discontinued.

A payphone stands at the corner, its receiver intact, its dial tone a mystery. The phones might still work. No one is calling to find out.`,
