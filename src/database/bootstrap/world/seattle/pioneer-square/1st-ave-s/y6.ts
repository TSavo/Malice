  description: `First Avenue crosses Washington Street at one of Pioneer Square's most architecturally significant intersections. The Grand Central Building occupies the northeast corner, its Romanesque arches and carved stone eagles speaking to the ambitions of 1890s Seattle—a frontier town desperately wanting to be a metropolis. The desperation paid off, for a while.

The intersection is wider than most, the streets expanded during a 1920s improvement project that prioritized automobile traffic over pedestrian scale. The extra width feels like a plaza now, the cars long gone, the pavement becoming something like public space by default rather than design.

Occidental Park is visible to the east, its dead trees marking the open space that once anchored the neighborhood's social life. The park's emptiness is visible from here, a void in the urban fabric that draws the eye even when there's nothing to see.`,
