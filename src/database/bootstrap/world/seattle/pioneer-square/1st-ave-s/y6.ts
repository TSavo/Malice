  description: `The avenue continues north from S. Washington toward Yesler Way and the wall of debris that blocks passage to Downtown. Smith Tower is visible ahead, its white terra cotta facade rising above the surrounding buildings.

A law office occupied the building here, its brass nameplate listing partners who practiced the kinds of law that required proximity to courthouses. The practice has been discontinued. The nameplate remains, promising services that can't be rendered.

A fire hydrant painted yellow stands at the curb, a remnant of the city's obsession with fire safety after 1889. The fires have been replaced by other concerns.`,
