  description: `First Avenue climbs the gentle grade toward Washington Street, following the natural slope that rises from the waterfront. The incline is barely noticeable to modern sensibilities, trained on level floors and graded roads, but it shaped the neighborhood's development. Water flows downhill. Commerce followed.

The Grand Central Building's southern face is visible ahead, its ornate facade marking the intersection with Washington Street. The building was designed to impress from this approach, its architects understanding that first impressions mattered more than logical ones. The impression it makes now is of endurance rather than grandeur.

A fire escape zigzags down the adjacent building's face, its metal stairs ending six feet above the sidewalk—a safety feature that became a security feature, the drop too high for casual access. The drop is still too high. The safety and security it provided are both obsolete.`,
