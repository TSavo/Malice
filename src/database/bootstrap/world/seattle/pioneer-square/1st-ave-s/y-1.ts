  description: `S. Main Street is just ahead, marking the center of Pioneer Square's commercial district. The Merchant's Cafe is visible at the intersection, claiming to be Seattle's oldest restaurant. The claim is painted in gold leaf on the window. The restaurant is dark. The claim persists.

A horse-drawn carriage once offered tours from this corner, clip-clopping through the historic district while a guide recited facts about the Great Fire and the rebuilding. The horse is gone. The carriage is gone. The facts remain, unrecited.

A hitching post stands at the curb, ornamental now but functional once. The ornament persists.`,
