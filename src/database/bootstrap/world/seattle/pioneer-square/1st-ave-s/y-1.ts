  description: `Main Street approaches from the north, the intersection visible where First Avenue crosses one of Pioneer Square's primary axes. The buildings grow slightly taller near the intersection, five and six stories rather than the three and four that line most of the avenue. Height meant status once, proximity to Main Street meaning higher rents, better visibility, more foot traffic. The foot traffic is gone. The height remains.

The sidewalks widen as the intersection approaches, the public right-of-way expanding to accommodate the crowds that once gathered at this commercial hub. The extra width feels like absence now, empty space where density once lived. The concrete is worn smooth in paths that feet no longer walk.

A street lamp leans at a slight angle, its pole bent by some long-ago impact—vehicle, falling debris, the physics of collapse. The lamp doesn't work regardless. The angle gives it a quality of arrested motion, falling forever without ever hitting the ground.`,
