  description: `Three eras of Seattle architecture collide at this block: a Romanesque Revival building from 1892, its arched windows filled with plywood; a concrete box from the 1960s, all function and no apology; and a glass-fronted renovation from 2015 that already looks dated. All three share the same silence now, the same dust on their doorsteps.

AAA BAIL BONDS occupies the 1960s box, its neon sign a tangle of dead tubes and empty promises. BAIL BONDS 24 HOURS. FREE PARKING. SE HABLA ESPAÑOL. Through the window, a desk still holds stacked papers, a telephone with a cord, a coffee mug with something growing in it. The business model assumed a functioning justice system. It assumed a lot of things.

A barber pole bolted to the brick facade catches the eye—the spiral stripes have faded to pink and grey, and the motor that once spun it has seized. The plate glass window behind it frames three chairs, three mirrors, three reflections of an empty room.`,
