  description: `The Corp Construction zone is visible to the east, its black fabric barriers blocking the view of whatever was being built. The zone doesn't extend to First Avenue, but its presence is felt, a shadow over the neighborhood.

A print shop occupied the ground floor here, producing posters and flyers and the paper ephemera of urban life. The presses are still. The paper has yellowed. The ephemera is all that's left.

A bike rack stands at the curb, its metal loops designed for bikes that messengers rode between buildings. The messengers are gone. The messages are undelivered.`,
