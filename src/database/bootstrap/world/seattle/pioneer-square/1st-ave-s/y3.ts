  description: `The Corp Construction barrier is visible one block east, black fabric stretched over chain-link, cutting the view like a curtain dropped across a stage. Whatever Corp was building over there, it was big enough to swallow three city blocks. The barrier doesn't extend to First Avenue, but it throws a shadow nonetheless—something about it feels like a held breath.

QuickPrint occupied the ground floor here, one of those shops that produced concert posters and band flyers and the paper detritus of a city with a music scene. The letterpress in the window still holds a forme locked with wood type: SATURDAY NIGHT. Whatever happened Saturday night, it's not happening anymore. Stacks of paper have yellowed in the window display, bleached by sun that doesn't care about ultraviolet damage.

A bike rack bolted to the sidewalk holds a single frame—no wheels, no handlebars, just a triangle of chrome tubing locked to the rack with a U-lock that would take an angle grinder to remove. Someone took everything they could. Someone left the rest.`,
