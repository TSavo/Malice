  description: `North of Jackson, First Avenue becomes emphatically Pioneer Square: Romanesque arches, carved stone faces staring down from cornices, brick the color of dried blood. These buildings survived the Great Fire of 1889 only because they hadn't been built yet—they're the second draft of Seattle, designed by architects who'd learned what fire could do.

A gallery called TERRA NOVA occupies a ground-floor space with floor-to-ceiling windows. Behind the glass, three large canvases hang on white walls: abstract expressionism, violent slashes of red and black. The artist was making a statement. The statement hangs there still, speaking to an empty room. A price tag dangles from one frame—$8,400—as if money still meant something.

A sodium streetlight flickers in an arrhythmic stutter overhead, its ballast dying by degrees. The orange light pulses across the facade, then fails, then pulses again. Something about it feels like a heartbeat winding down.`,
