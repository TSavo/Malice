  description: `The avenue continues north from S. Jackson, deeper into Pioneer Square. The buildings grow older and more ornate here, the Romanesque Revival architecture that defines the neighborhood asserting itself in brick and stone.

An art gallery occupies the ground floor, its windows displaying pieces that were avant-garde when they were hung. The avant-garde has become irrelevant. The pieces remain, challenging viewers who no longer view.

A streetlight flickers overhead, its bulb failing but not yet failed. The light comes and goes, casting uncertain shadows on the sidewalk.`,
