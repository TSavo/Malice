  description: `First Avenue continues its steady progress through Pioneer Square, the buildings on either side maintaining the Victorian consistency that preservation ordinances once enforced. The ordinances are meaningless now, but the consistency remains—brick facades, arched windows, cornices decorated with carved stone. The buildings were built to last, and they have.

A ghost sign is painted on one brick wall, advertising a business that closed before the collapse: PIONEER SQUARE ANTIQUES - ESTABLISHED 1978. The irony of an antique store in a neighborhood that has itself become antique would have appealed to someone once. The sign fades a little more each year.

Storm drains line the curb, their grates clogged with decades of debris. When it rains—and in Seattle, it always rains eventually—the water pools and finds its own path, following gravity through the ruins rather than the infrastructure designed to guide it.`,
