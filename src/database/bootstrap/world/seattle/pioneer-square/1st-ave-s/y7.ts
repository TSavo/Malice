  description: `The Hotel Morrison fills the east side of the block, six stories of brick and terracotta from the 1920s, back when Pioneer Square hotels catered to merchant sailors and longshoremen. The building went upscale in the 2000s—exposed brick boutique rooms, a rooftop bar, rates that would have made those longshoremen choke on their whiskey. The rooftop bar's neon sign still hangs from the parapet: SUMMIT. The neon tubes have gone milky with age, holding their last charge of gas like a held breath.

Fire escapes zigzag down the hotel's facade, each landing a small stage. On the fourth floor, someone left a suitcase on the landing—hard-shell Samsonite, the kind with combination locks. It sits there still, latches facing out, whatever's inside sealed away. An evacuation interrupted, or a decision reversed, or just someone who set their bag down for a moment and never picked it up again.

The lobby doors are plate glass etched with art deco patterns, geometric sunbursts that catch the grey light. Through them you can see a marble floor, a reception desk with a brass bell, wingback chairs arranged around a fireplace that burns nothing. The clock above the desk stopped at 3:47. Morning or afternoon, impossible to say.`,
