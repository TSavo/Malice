  description: `Smith Tower grows closer, its spire a landmark that guided people through the neighborhood before everything needed guiding. The tower was the tallest building west of the Mississippi when it opened in 1914. The claim seems quaint now. Height doesn't matter when everyone is at ground level.

A hotel occupied one building, providing rooms for visitors who wanted to experience Pioneer Square's nightlife. The nightlife has ended. The rooms are dark. The experience is no longer available.

A neon sign hangs over the hotel entrance, its tubes cold and dark. The sign promised VACANCY. The vacancy is universal now.`,
