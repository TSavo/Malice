  description: `A small plaza opens up on the west side of the street, one of the pocket parks that dot Pioneer Square. The plaza has benches and trees and a fountain that no longer runs. The water in the fountain has evaporated, leaving a basin of coins and leaves and optimism.

The benches face the fountain as if expecting a performance. The performance has been cancelled. The benches continue their vigil.

A bronze plaque mounted on a pedestal explains the history of the plaza. The history has ended. The explanation continues.`,
