// 1st Ave S - between S. Main and S. Washington

  description: `The avenue continues north from S. Main, passing through the heart of Pioneer Square's gallery district. Art spaces and studios occupy the upper floors of buildings that were warehouses a century ago. The art remains. The artists are gone.

A coffee shop served the gallery crowd, espresso and pastries and conversations about meaning. The conversations have ended. The espresso machine is cold. The meaning is debatable.

A sandwich board on the sidewalk advertises an opening that opened and closed and will never open again. The chalk has faded. The advertisement persists.`,
