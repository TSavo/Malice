  description: `Pioneer Square's gallery row begins here—or began here, or whatever tense applies to things that existed and then stopped. A dozen studios and exhibition spaces occupy the upper floors of these old warehouses, their windows tall enough to admit the grey Seattle light that painters supposedly loved. The galleries have names like AXIS and TWELVE and SPACE, words chosen to mean nothing and everything.

Through the windows of TWELVE, you can see white walls hung with photographs: black and white portraits of people's hands, close-up studies of wrinkles and calluses. The gallery had a show about work. Manual labor. Blue collar hands. The irony probably wasn't intentional.

Below the galleries, a coffee shop called Zeitgeist pitched itself to the art crowd—exposed brick, mismatched furniture, a chalkboard menu with prices that assumed a certain kind of customer. The espresso machine is a chrome beast behind the counter, Italian, probably worth more than some of the art upstairs. The cups stacked beside it have gathered a film of grey dust.`,
