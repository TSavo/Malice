  description: `The intersection of 1st Ave S and Yesler Way—or what's left of it. The debris wall from the collapsed Merrill Building completely blocks the street to the north, a six-story pile of rubble that marks where Pioneer Square ends and downtown begins. Or began.

Smith Tower stands at the northeast corner, its white terra cotta spire rising above the destruction. The tower survived whatever brought everything else down. Continuum moved in afterward, turning the historic landmark into their banking headquarters. Their logo gleams on the building's facade.

Yesler Way runs east from here, following the original skid road where logs once rolled downhill to Henry Yesler's mill. The street still carries that legacy in its name, if nothing else. The sawmill is long gone. The logs. The workers. All of it.

Traffic signals hang dark and useless above the intersection. The last time they changed, nobody was here to see it.`,
