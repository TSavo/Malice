  description: `A parking garage entrance yawns open on the east side of the street, its darkness absolute, its depths unknowable. The garage served the stadium crowds and the office workers and anyone willing to pay the rates. The rates are posted. No one is paying.

The buildings here are mixed use, retail on the ground floor and offices or apartments above. The retail is dark. The offices are empty. The apartments may or may not contain people. It's hard to tell from the street.

A newspaper box stands at the corner, its window displaying a headline from a day when headlines mattered.`,
