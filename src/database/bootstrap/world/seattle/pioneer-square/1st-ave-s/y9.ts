  description: `Yesler Way opens just ahead, and with it the view of Smith Tower rising at the intersection—thirty-eight stories of white terra cotta, an Edwardian giant watching over a dead city. The tower was L.C. Smith's monument to ambition, typewriter money transformed into height and permanence. The typewriters are museum pieces now. The tower still stands. There's probably a lesson in that about what survives.

The debris wall reaches nearly to the tower's base, a frozen avalanche of brick and steel and shattered glass. From this angle you can see where the Merrill Building's upper floors accordioned down onto the lower ones, each floor pancaking into the one below until the whole structure became a single compressed mass. The physics of collapse, demonstrated in brick. Downtown's grid meets Pioneer Square's here at an angle—the two men who platted Seattle couldn't agree on which way was north. The grids collide at Yesler. They always did. The rubble just made it visible.

A bus shelter stands at the corner, its plexiglass walls spider-webbed with cracks but still upright. The route map inside shows lines that once connected Pioneer Square to Capitol Hill, to Ballard, to places that might as well be other planets now. The 99 ran this route. The schedule promised a bus every fifteen minutes. The next bus is not coming.`,
