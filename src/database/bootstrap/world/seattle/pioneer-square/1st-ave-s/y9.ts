// 1st Ave S - between S. Washington and Yesler Way

  description: `Yesler Way is just ahead, and with it the impassable wall of debris that blocks all northward travel on this avenue. Smith Tower stands at the intersection, its ornate lobby visible through glass doors, its upper floors silent.

The debris is massive, six stories of building collapsed into a heap that reaches from facade to facade. The street grids never quite aligned here anyway, Downtown's grid meeting Pioneer Square's at an angle. The collision of grids has been made physical.

A sign on the debris fence says DANGER - NO ENTRY. The danger is obvious. The entry is impossible. The sign is redundant.`,
