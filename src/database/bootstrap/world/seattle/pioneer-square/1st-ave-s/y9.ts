// 1st Ave S - south of Smith Tower entrance

  name: '1st Ave S',
  description: `Smith Tower's white terra cotta facade rises to the north, its ground floor windows dark and unwelcoming. This stretch of 1st Ave runs along the tower's western face—thirty-eight stories of Edwardian ambition casting a permanent shadow over the street below.

The sidewalk here is cracked but clear, the debris from the collapse having been pushed aside at some point to create a narrow passage. A service entrance to the tower is visible nearby, utilitarian compared to the grand lobbies on the north side. CONTINUUM BANKING reads a small placard beside the door.

Across the street, the storefronts that once housed Pioneer Square's boutiques and galleries stand empty. A vintage clothing store. An art gallery. A coffee shop with chairs still stacked inside. The windows are intact, the interiors frozen in the moment everyone left.`,
