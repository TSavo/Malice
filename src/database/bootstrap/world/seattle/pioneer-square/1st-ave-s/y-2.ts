  description: `Bill Speidel's Underground Tour operated from this block for sixty years, leading tourists down into the buried streets beneath Pioneer Square. After the Great Fire, Seattle didn't rebuild at street level—it rebuilt one story up and paved over the ruins. The old sidewalks and storefronts are still down there, sealed in darkness, preserved in the airless spaces beneath the new city.

The tour entrance is a purple door wedged between a shuttered souvenir shop and a defunct espresso stand. A sandwich board lies face-down on the sidewalk, its chalkboard message hidden. Through the gift shop window: t-shirts that read I SURVIVED THE UNDERGROUND TOUR and coffee mugs shaped like rats and snow globes containing tiny Pioneer Square streetscapes. All of it coated in dust. All of it unsold.

The underground is still down there, of course. Darker now than ever. The tours brought lights and voices and the shuffle of feet. Now it's just the drip of groundwater and whatever rats survived to inherit it.`,
