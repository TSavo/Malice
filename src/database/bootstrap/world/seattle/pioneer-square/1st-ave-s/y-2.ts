  description: `The Underground Tour entrance is nearby, one of the attractions that drew tourists to Pioneer Square. The tour explored the buried streets beneath the current city, the original Seattle that was covered over after the Great Fire. The tours have stopped. The underground waits, darker than ever.

A gift shop sold souvenirs of the underground experience. Postcards and books and things that said "I SURVIVED THE UNDERGROUND TOUR." The survival seems ironic now. The souvenirs remain, celebrating an underground that survived when the surface did not.

A sign points the way to the tour entrance. The entrance is locked. The pointing continues.`,
