  description: `Main Street opens ahead, and with it the heart of Pioneer Square's old commercial district. The Merchant's Cafe anchors the corner in weathered brick, its window still proclaiming SEATTLE'S OLDEST RESTAURANT in gold leaf that's flaking at the edges. EST. 1890. Through the glass: a mahogany bar, stools with torn leather seats, bottles arranged on shelves behind the bar in neat rows. The arrangement suggests someone left expecting to return.

The carriage tours launched from this corner—tourists in horse-drawn buggies, clip-clopping past historic buildings while guides recited facts about the Great Fire. The carriage is gone, probably stabled somewhere that isn't here. The horse that pulled it is probably dead. A hitching post remains bolted to the curb, cast iron shaped into a horse's head, rings for reins on either side. Decorative for fifty years, functional for fifty before that. Now just a shape.

The curb cut here still shows yellow paint where carriages loaded passengers. The paint has faded to a color that doesn't have a name.`,
