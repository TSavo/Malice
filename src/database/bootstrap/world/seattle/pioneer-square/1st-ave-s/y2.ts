  description: `A nightclub occupied the basement of one building, its entrance a nondescript door that led down into darkness and music and the kind of experiences that happened after midnight. The music has stopped. The experiences have ended. The door is locked.

A bouncer's stool sits outside the door, empty but positioned as if someone might return to check IDs. No one is returning. The stool waits anyway.

The buildings here are connected by a network of underground passages, remnants of the buried city. The entrances are sealed. The passages persist, dark and silent beneath the street.`,
