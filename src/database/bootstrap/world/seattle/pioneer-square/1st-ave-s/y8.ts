  description: `The debris wall dominates the view north—six stories of the Merrill Building brought down in a cascade that filled the intersection like concrete poured into a mold. Rebar tangles through the rubble like metal vines. A section of facade leans against the pile at a forty-five degree angle, windows still intact in their frames, reflecting nothing. Somewhere in that mass of brick and steel are the things that were inside the building when it fell. Office furniture. Files. People. The pile doesn't distinguish.

Dust coats everything this close to the collapse. A fine grey powder that settles on windowsills, gathers in doorways, films the surfaces of parked cars until they all look the same color. The dust gets in your lungs if you breathe too deep. It tastes like chalk and age and things that used to be solid.

Orange construction fencing runs across the street, jersey barriers behind it, the whole apparatus of official response that happened before there was no one left to respond. DANGER - UNSTABLE STRUCTURE reads a sign wired to the fence. The structure has been unstable for years now. Nothing has fallen since the initial collapse. Nothing has been cleared either. The rubble has become geography.`,
