  description: `The debris blocking passage north is visible now, a wall of rubble where a building collapsed across the intersection at Yesler Way. The collapse sealed this route to Downtown, one of many blockages that turned Pioneer Square into a dead end.

A construction fence has been placed around the debris, orange plastic mesh that was meant to be temporary. The temporary has become permanent. The fence remains, protecting no one from nothing.

The smell here is different, dust and decay and something else. The collapse disturbed things that had been buried. Some of them should have stayed buried.`,
