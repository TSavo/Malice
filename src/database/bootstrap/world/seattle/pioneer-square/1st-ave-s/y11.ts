// 1st Ave S - north of Smith Tower entrance, approaching Yesler

  name: '1st Ave S',
  description: `The intersection with Yesler Way is just ahead, marked by the massive debris pile that blocks passage to downtown. Smith Tower stands to the east, its white facade bright against the grey sky. The building's main entrance faces Yesler, but a side entrance here on 1st Ave provides access to the tower's Continuum Bank facilities.

The debris wall dominates the northern view—the collapsed Merrill Building formed a barrier that stretches across the intersection, effectively sealing Pioneer Square from downtown Seattle. Rebar protrudes from the rubble like metal bones. Dust still coats everything, decades later.

A few hardy weeds have pushed through cracks in the sidewalk, the only living things that seem to thrive here. The street is silent except for wind whistling through broken windows.`,
