  description: `The stadiums loom to the west, visible through gaps in the buildings. The mall was designed to funnel crowds from the stadiums into the bars and restaurants of Pioneer Square. The funnel is empty now. The crowds have dissipated.

A street performer's spot is marked by a worn circle in the cobblestones, the place where a musician or magician or living statue drew audiences. The performances have ended. The audience has gone. The worn spot remains, a monument to entertainment.

Fallen leaves have accumulated in the gutters, seasons of decay that no one has swept away.`,
