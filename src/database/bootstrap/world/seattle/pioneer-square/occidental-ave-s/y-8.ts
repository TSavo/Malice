  description: `A brass plaque set into the cobblestones marks this spot as the site of a totem pole that stood here for decades—carved by Tlingit artists, stolen from Alaska in 1899, eventually replaced with an authorized copy after the original burned. The replacement was removed for "restoration" before the Event. The plaque remains, explaining the history of something that isn't here anymore. History explaining absence. It feels appropriate.

A circle worn into the bricks marks where a street performer used to draw crowds—you can see it if you look, a patch slightly lighter than the surrounding stone, polished by shuffling feet that stopped to watch whatever magic happened here. Guitar case open. Coins tossed. Applause echoing off brick facades. The performer took their talent elsewhere. The worn spot remains like a scar.

Someone dragged a shopping cart here and left it tipped on its side, wheels still spinning slowly when the wind catches them. The cart held blankets once, or cans, or someone's entire portable existence. The blankets are gone, scattered or stolen or just blown away. A single sock remains tangled in the cart's wire mesh—grey wool, hole in the heel, the kind of detail that makes you wonder about the foot that wore it and where that foot walked next.`,
