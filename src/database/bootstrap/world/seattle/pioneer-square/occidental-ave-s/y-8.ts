  description: `A loading dock gapes open on the eastern side of the avenue, its metal rollup door frozen half-raised, rust having welded it in place decades ago. The darkness beyond suggests depth—a warehouse or storage facility that once served the businesses above. The smell of mold and stagnant water drifts from the opening.

The western buildings here are brick Victorians, three and four stories, their facades decorated with the ornamental flourishes that late nineteenth-century architects considered essential. Carved stone faces peer down from cornices—lions, eagles, human visages worn smooth by a century of rain. Their expressions have become ambiguous, features eroding into suggestions.

Broken glass crunches underfoot where it's collected in the gaps between cobblestones. The shards have been ground down by weather and time into something almost like gravel, glittering dully in the light.`,
