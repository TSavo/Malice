// Occidental Ave S - between S. Washington and Yesler Way

  description: `The debris blocking Yesler Way is fully visible now, a mass of brick and concrete and steel that fills the intersection ahead. The collapse happened during the Event, one of many collapses that sealed Pioneer Square off from Downtown.

A construction crane lies twisted in the debris, its arm bent at an impossible angle, its operator's cab crushed. The crane was building something when the building stopped. The irony writes itself.

The maple trees end here, giving way to dust and destruction. The canopy of green yields to a wall of gray.`,
