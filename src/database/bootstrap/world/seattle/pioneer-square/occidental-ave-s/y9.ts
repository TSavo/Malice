// Occidental Ave S - between S. Washington and Yesler Way

  description: `Yesler Way is just ahead, and with it the end of the Occidental Mall. The debris that blocks the intersection rises three stories high, a wall of rubble that turns the pedestrian zone into a dead end.

A sign warns of the danger ahead, its red letters faded but readable. ROAD CLOSED. The road is more than closed. The road is buried.

The cobblestones end here, their careful preservation pointless at the edge of destruction. The history the stones represent has been interrupted. The future the stones were meant to see has been cancelled.

The only way forward is back.`,
