// Occidental Ave S - between S. Washington and Yesler Way

  name: 'Occidental Ave S',
  description: `The avenue climbs slightly here as it approaches Yesler Way, following the natural grade that once made this hillside ideal for skidding logs down to Henry Yesler's mill. The incline is barely perceptible now, smoothed by a century of street improvements, but feet can feel what eyes can't see.

The buildings on this block are a mix of brick and stone, their ground floors showing the characteristic high ceilings and large windows of commercial space designed for natural light. Before electricity became cheap, architects worked harder. The windows are dark now, but they still catch what light the sky offers.

A ghost sign is barely visible on one brick facade—white paint faded almost to illegibility, advertising a business whose name can only be partially reconstructed. SOMETHING & SON. ESTABLISHED 18-something. The son would be long dead even if the world hadn't ended.`,
