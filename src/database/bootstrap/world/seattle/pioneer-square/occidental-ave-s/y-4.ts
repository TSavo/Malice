  description: `The pedestrian character of Occidental Avenue is most evident here, where the cobblestones spread wide and the buildings step back from the street. This was designed as public space—benches, planters, room to breathe in a neighborhood otherwise compressed by Victorian lot lines. The design intent survives even if the public doesn't.

A series of decorative lamp posts line the avenue, their globes clouded with age and internal moisture. The posts were installed during a 1970s beautification project, meant to evoke gas lamps without the inconvenience of actual gas. The electricity that powered them is long gone. The evocation of history continues, unlit.

Moss has colonized the north-facing surfaces of every building here, green creeping up brick and stone with patient determination. In another few decades it might consume the facades entirely, turning architecture back into landscape.`,
