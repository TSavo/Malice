// Occidental Ave S - between S. Jackson and S. Main

  name: 'Occidental Ave S',
  description: `The mall continues north from S. Jackson, the cobblestones widening into a proper pedestrian plaza. This was the heart of Pioneer Square's social life, where people gathered for First Thursday art walks and farmers markets and the casual collisions of urban existence.

A bronze firefighter statue stands at the edge of the plaza, commemorating the department that rebuilt after 1889. The firefighter holds a hose, frozen in the act of fighting flames that went out long ago. The statue is green with verdigris, patient and permanent.

Cafe tables and chairs are scattered across the plaza, arranged by wind and time into patterns no designer intended.`,
