// Occidental Ave S - between S. King and S. Jackson

  name: 'Occidental Ave S',
  description: `S. Jackson Street is just ahead, its intersection marking passage between the stadium district to the south and Pioneer Square's commercial core to the north. King Street Station is visible to the east, its clock tower keeping time for trains that don't run.

A flower cart occupied this corner during daylight hours, selling bouquets and arrangements and the small beauties that made urban life bearable. The cart is gone. The flowers are gone. The beauty has relocated to wherever beauty goes.

A fire station plaque on a nearby building commemorates the volunteers who fought the Great Fire. They lost. The city rebuilt. The plaque remains.`,
