  description: `The cobblestones here have buckled and heaved, frost cycles and neglect conspiring to turn what was once a carefully laid pedestrian way into something resembling a frozen sea. The bricks jut at angles, creating trip hazards that would have generated lawsuits in the old world. Now they're just terrain.

A building on the west side has partially collapsed, its upper floors pancaked onto the lower ones in a cascade of brick and timber. The collapse looks old—decades old—the edges softened by weather, weeds growing from the rubble pile. Whatever happened here happened long ago. No one cleaned it up. No one will.

The street narrows where debris has spilled across the roadway, forcing passage through a gap barely wide enough for two people abreast. The walls on either side lean inward slightly, creating a sense of compression, of the city slowly closing in on itself.`,
