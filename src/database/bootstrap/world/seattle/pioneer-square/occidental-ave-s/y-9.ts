  description: `The Occidental Mall begins here at its southern end, the pedestrian zone that runs through the heart of Pioneer Square. The cobblestones underfoot are original, survivors of the Great Fire, worn smooth by a century of feet that no longer walk.

The maple trees that line the mall have grown wild, their branches untrimmed, reaching across the walkway to touch each other. The careful urban forestry has become a tunnel of green.

A wrought-iron bench sits beneath the trees, its slats designed for comfort, its paint chipped and peeling. The bench invited sitting. No one is sitting.`,
