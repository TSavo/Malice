  description: `A wine bar occupied the corner here, its racks still visible through the window, bottles arranged by region and vintage. The vintages continue to age. The regions no longer export. The wine waits for someone to drink it.

The cobblestones are worn smooth here, polished by decades of foot traffic that has stopped. The smoothness feels strange underfoot, history made tangible, time made physical.

A planter box sits at the edge of the walkway, its flowers long dead, its soil dry and cracked. Someone planted petunias or impatiens or something cheerful. The cheer has withered.`,
