  description: `Waterfall Garden Park hides behind a brick wall to the east, one of Seattle's strangest landmarks—a twenty-two foot artificial waterfall tucked into a courtyard the size of a parking space. UPS built it in 1978 to mark the site where the company started, back when it was the American Messenger Company and James Casey was a teenager with an idea. The waterfall runs on a recirculating pump, no input required, just electricity and physics. Against all odds, it's still running. You can hear it through the wall—the rush of water that never goes anywhere, falling and rising and falling again in an endless loop.

The wrought-iron gate stands open, its hours of operation sign still mounted on the wall: 8AM-5PM MONDAY-FRIDAY. The schedule hasn't been enforced in so long that moss has begun to grow in the hinges. Beyond the gate, a narrow passage leads to the courtyard where the waterfall cascades over concrete terraces into a pool. Ferns crowd the walls. The space was designed to feel secret, discovered, a hidden garden in the urban jungle. It still feels that way. The secret has just stopped being shared.

A bronze plaque near the gate tells the UPS story—the bicycle messengers, the twenty-dollar startup, the rise to global logistics dominance. The plaque is green with age, the letters filling with verdigris. Success stories read differently when you're standing in the wreckage of the success.`,
