  description: `The Waterfall Garden Park is nearby, a private park built by UPS to honor the site where the company was founded. The waterfall still runs, fed by some mechanism that doesn't require human intervention. The sound of falling water is the only sound here.

The park is behind a gate that was always open during business hours. The hours have been discontinued. The gate remains open, its schedule no longer relevant.

A plaque explains the park's history. The history continues to be explained to no one.`,
