  description: `The Occidental Mall narrows here as it approaches its terminus, the cobblestones transitioning into plain concrete where someone ran out of budget or enthusiasm for historical authenticity. Ahead, the debris wall at Yesler Way rises into view, a tumbled mass of brick and steel that closes the street like a dam.

To the east, the Corp Construction barriers run along the block—black fabric over chain-link, the kind of screening that hides embarrassments and mysteries in equal measure. Whatever Corp was building swallowed three city blocks, and the barriers went up before anyone could see what was growing inside. The barriers are still up. Whatever grew or didn't grow is still hidden. The mystery has outlasted everyone curious enough to investigate it.

OBLIQUE STRATEGIES reads the plaque beneath a public art installation—steel rods of varying heights arranged in a pattern that might be random or might be calculated, the kind of sculpture that required a grant application and an artist's statement full of words like "liminality" and "negotiated space." The rods have rusted in streaks of orange and brown. Whether that was the artist's intention is impossible to determine. Whether anything was the artist's intention is impossible to determine.`,
