  description: `North of Main Street, Occidental Avenue resumes its pedestrian character, cobblestones reappearing underfoot as the street transitions back into plaza space. The park is visible ahead, its dead trees standing like monuments to a greener past.

The buildings here housed galleries and design firms in the before times—creative industries that clustered in Pioneer Square for the exposed brick and affordable rents. The galleries are dark now, their windows showing empty walls where art once hung. The design firms designed nothing anymore. The affordable rents became irrelevant when currency collapsed.

A decorative iron fence runs along one building's frontage, its bars topped with spear points that were ornamental rather than defensive. The distinction has become academic. Everything is potentially defensive now, or potentially useless.`,
