// Occidental Ave S - between S. Washington and Yesler Way

  description: `The mall continues north from S. Washington, the cobblestones giving way to concrete as the pedestrian zone transitions toward its end at Yesler Way. The debris blocking northward travel is visible ahead, a wall of rubble that terminates the mall's ambitions.

The Corp Construction zone is visible to the east, its black fabric barriers marking the boundary of whatever they were building. The mystery persists. The barriers reveal nothing.

A public art installation stands at the edge of the walkway, abstract metal forms that meant something to the artist. The meaning is lost. The metal remains, rusting slowly.`,
