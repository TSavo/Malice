  description: `The pergola stretches overhead here, its wooden beams casting striped shadows on the cobblestones below. The structure was built to provide shelter and beauty. The shelter remains. The beauty is subjective.

A homeless man's bedroll is wedged into one corner of the pergola, positioned out of the rain, arranged with the care of someone who understood that small comforts matter. The man is gone. The bedroll remains, a claim on space that no one contests.

Pigeons roost in the pergola's rafters, cooing and shifting and dropping evidence of their presence on the cobblestones below.`,
