  description: `The mall continues north from the center point, the cobblestones narrowing slightly as the pedestrian zone transitions from plaza to pathway. The buildings press closer here, their brick facades creating a canyon of history.

A restaurant occupied the ground floor of one building, its tables visible through windows that haven't been cleaned in months. The tables are set, waiting for diners who won't arrive. The napkins are folded. The silverware is arranged. The meal is indefinitely postponed.

A vintage lamp post stands at the corner, its globe intact, its light extinguished. The lamp was designed to evoke gas light and simpler times. The times have simplified beyond recognition.`,
