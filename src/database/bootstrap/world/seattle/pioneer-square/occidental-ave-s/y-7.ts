  description: `STONINGTON GALLERY reads the sign above a storefront that dealt in Northwest Coast art—bentwood boxes, cedar masks, prints by artists whose names meant something in certain circles. The gallery window still holds a display: a raven mask with mother-of-pearl eyes, positioned to catch light that no longer matters. The mask's expression suggests it finds something funny about all this. Raven usually does.

Tree roots have heaved the cobblestones here, creating ridges and valleys in what was meant to be a flat pedestrian surface. The city fought this battle for decades, trimming roots, releveling stones, fighting the slow vegetable insistence of maples that wanted more room. The trees have won. Their roots crack through the brick like fingers pushing up through a grave.

A drinking fountain stands at the walkway's edge, the kind with a steel basin and a push-button spout, a gift from some Rotary Club whose plaque has weathered into illegibility. The basin has become a planter—moss grows thick in the bowl, small ferns sprouting from cracks in the concrete base. Whatever water pressure once fed the fountain gave out long ago. The infrastructure beneath the street is as silent as the street itself.`,
