  description: `A gallery occupies the ground floor of one building, its windows displaying Northwest art and Native crafts and things that tourists bought to remember Seattle by. The tourists are gone. The memories are unclaimed. The art waits for eyes that don't come.

The cobblestones are uneven here, pushed up by tree roots that don't respect urban planning. The unevenness was charming once, evidence of history fighting through. Now it's just uneven ground.

A drinking fountain stands at the edge of the walkway, its basin dry, its spout silent. The fountain was a gift from some civic organization. The gift has run out.`,
