  description: `The avenue widens slightly here, a small plaza carved out of the streetscape where food carts once gathered during lunch hours. The asphalt shows the ghostly outlines of where trucks parked daily, oil stains marking territories as clearly as any fence. The lunch crowds are gone. The food carts are gone. The oil stains remain, petroleum fossils of a working economy.

An old street clock stands at the plaza's edge, its face cracked, hands frozen at 2:47. These clocks were installed throughout Pioneer Square in the 1980s, replicas of Victorian designs meant to evoke the neighborhood's heritage. The heritage they evoked is now as dead as the clock itself.

Fire escapes zigzag down the eastern building's facade, their metal ladders extended to street level as if expecting evacuees who never came. The rust on the railings has progressed past orange into a deep brown that flakes at the slightest touch.`,
