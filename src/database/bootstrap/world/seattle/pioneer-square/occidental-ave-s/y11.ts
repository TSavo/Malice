// Occidental Ave S - approaching Yesler Way

  name: 'Occidental Ave S',
  description: `Yesler Way is just ahead, the diagonal slash that marks where Pioneer Square's orderly grid collides with downtown's angled streets. The intersection has always been awkward—triangular buildings, odd corners, streets meeting at angles that confuse navigation. The confusion remains even without anyone to be confused by it.

The buildings here show blast damage on their upper floors—windows blown out, brick facades scarred by shrapnel or debris. Whatever hit this area during the wars or the burning left marks that weather hasn't erased. The lower floors are largely intact, protected by the buildings across the street that absorbed the worst of it.

A faded mural wraps around one corner, its colors sun-bleached into pastels. The image depicts the neighborhood's history—the sawmill, the fire, the rebuilding, the preservation. The story ends mid-panel where the paint has peeled away entirely, leaving bare brick. An appropriate conclusion.`,
