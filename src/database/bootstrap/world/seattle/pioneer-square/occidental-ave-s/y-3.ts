  description: `The pergola spans the park here, cedar beams weathered silver-grey, the kind of urban furniture that cities build when they want to signal investment in public space. Wisteria was supposed to climb these posts and drape the beams in purple, but the vines died years ago, leaving just the skeleton of intention. Rain drips through the slats in patterns that shift with the wind.

Someone made a home in the pergola's southeast corner—sleeping bag rated for twenty degrees, foam pad beneath it, a milk crate serving as nightstand and storage. Plastic bags hang from the pergola's crossbeams like ornaments, holding clothes or food or whatever else fit in a life small enough to carry. The inhabitant is elsewhere, or everywhere, or nowhere. The camp remains, unmolested by the absent authorities, unclaimed by anyone else. There's an etiquette to these spaces that survives even the end of things.

Pigeons have colonized the rafters, their cooing a constant murmur like distant conversation. Droppings streak the wooden beams, accumulate on the cobblestones below in patterns that would be abstract art if anyone were looking for meaning. A feather drifts down, grey with bars of darker grey, and settles in a crack between stones where it will stay until something moves it.`,
