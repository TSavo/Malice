  description: `Occidental Park occupies the east side of the mall here, a small urban square with benches and trees and a pergola that provided shade for lunch crowds. The crowds have dispersed. The shade remains, falling on no one.

A totem pole stands at the corner of the park, carved by Duane Pasco in 1971, depicting figures from Coast Salish mythology. The figures watch the empty park with expressions that could be wisdom or resignation. It's hard to tell with carved faces.

A chess table is built into one of the benches, its squares faded but visible. The games have ended. The strategy is moot.`,
