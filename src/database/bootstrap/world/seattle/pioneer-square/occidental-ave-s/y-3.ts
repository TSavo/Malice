  description: `Duane Pasco's totem pole rises at the corner of Occidental Park, forty feet of red cedar carved in 1971 by an artist who studied under the old masters. The figures stacked along its length tell stories—Raven and Bear and figures that don't translate easily into English. At the top, an eagle spreads wings that cast no shadow because the sky is grey and has been grey since you can remember. The paint has weathered to soft earth tones, reds and blacks fading into the wood like secrets being kept.

Chess tables are built into the concrete benches along the park's edge, their checkerboard surfaces worn by decades of games. The old men who played here knew each other's openings, each other's weaknesses, each other's reasons for being in a park at noon on a Tuesday. They brought their own pieces—weighted Staunton sets in velvet bags, or plastic pieces scavenged from incomplete sets, the makeshift matched against the proper. The squares are still visible beneath a layer of grime. The games are not resuming.

A bronze sundial stands on a pedestal near the chess tables, its gnomon pointing at an angle calculated for Seattle's latitude. The sundial worked when the sun shone. It works now only as sculpture, as suggestion, as a reminder that time once mattered enough to measure with shadows.`,
