  description: `S. Main Street opens just ahead, and with it Pioneer Square's most photographed landmark—the totem pole at the intersection, sixty feet of carved cedar that Seattle businessmen stole from a Tlingit village in 1899 and erected here as a trophy of civic ambition. The original burned in 1938. The city had the nerve to ask the Tlingit for a replacement. They charged $5,000 and sent the new pole with a note: "Thanks for paying for the first one." The story is on a plaque at the pole's base, sanitized into heritage.

ARUNDEL BOOKS occupies the corner building, three floors of used and antiquarian titles stacked floor to ceiling in the way that only real bookstores achieve. The window display hasn't changed in months, maybe years—first editions under glass, travel guides to places that don't function anymore, a handwritten card promising "We Buy Books." The door is unlocked. It usually was. The owner believed in trust, or indifference, or the understanding that anyone desperate enough to steal books probably needed them more than he needed the sale.

A sandwich board lies face-down on the cobblestones, knocked over by wind or carelessness. It advertised something once—coffee, maybe, or a poetry reading, or the kind of optimistic event that required advertising. Whatever it was happened or didn't. The board lies there still, its message pressed against stone, speaking to no one.`,
