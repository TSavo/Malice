  description: `The transition toward Main Street brings a subtle shift in architecture—the buildings here are slightly newer, early twentieth century rather than late nineteenth, their ornamentation more restrained. The Victorians gave way to the Edwardians gave way to whatever came next. Now they're all just old together.

A recessed doorway on the west side shows signs of habitation—blankets piled in the corner, the smell of old smoke, marks on the walls from cooking fires long extinguished. Someone lived here once, after everything fell apart. Whether they moved on or simply stopped living is impossible to say.

The cobblestones give way to asphalt as the avenue approaches Main Street, the pedestrian zone ending where the cross-street begins. The transition is marked by a change in texture underfoot, smooth replacing rough, modern replacing historical.`,
