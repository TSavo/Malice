// Occidental Ave S - between S. Jackson and S. Main

  description: `S. Main Street is just ahead, marking the center of the map, the zero point of Pioneer Square's geography. The intersection at Occidental and Main is where everything was measured from, back when measuring mattered.

A second totem pole is visible ahead at the intersection, older and more famous than the one in Occidental Park. The city stole it from Alaska in 1899 and never quite apologized. The theft seems minor now, in the context of everything.

A bookstore occupies the corner, its window displaying titles that were bestsellers once. The sellers have stopped selling. The books wait for readers.`,
