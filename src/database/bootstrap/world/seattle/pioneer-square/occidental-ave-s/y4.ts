// Occidental Ave S - between S. Main and S. Washington

  name: 'Occidental Ave S',
  description: `S. Washington Street is just ahead, its intersection marking the transition from Pioneer Square's core to its northern edge. The buildings beyond are slightly newer, slightly less ornate, the neighborhood fading toward the collapsed building that blocks Yesler Way.

A boutique hotel occupied one building, offering rooms with exposed brick and reclaimed wood and the industrial chic that was fashionable when fashions existed. The rooms are empty now. The chic has become just industrial.

A bike share station stands at the corner, its docking ports full, its bikes uncharged and waiting for riders who won't come.`,
