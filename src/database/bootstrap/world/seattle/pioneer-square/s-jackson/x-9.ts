  description: `First Avenue crosses S. Jackson Street at a corner that marks the transition from waterfront to neighborhood. The International District is visible to the east, its character distinct, its silence the same as everywhere else.

A martial arts supply store occupies the corner, its window displaying uniforms and training equipment and weapons that require skill to use. The students who trained here are gone. The equipment waits for hands that remember the forms.

A traffic signal cycles through its colors, green to yellow to red, governing traffic that no longer exists. The light is consistent. The traffic is not.

The intersection is clear. First Avenue runs north and south. S. Jackson continues east and west.`,
