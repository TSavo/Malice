// S. Jackson St - approaching Occidental

  description: `Occidental Avenue approaches from the north, its intersection marking the approximate boundary between the International District's Asian character and Pioneer Square's Victorian district. The transition is gradual—Chinese signage fading as Victorian brick becomes prominent—but both traditions arrive at the same abandonment. The overlap this block captures is the overlap of decay.

KEEFER BAKERY occupies a narrow storefront, its display cases empty and dark. The Chinese bakery specialized in pastries that dim sum restaurants served: egg tarts, pineapple buns, the barbecue pork buns that Cantonese bakeries perfected. The glass shelving designed to showcase the day's production showcases only dust. The ovens in back are cold. The last day's production was fifty-five years ago, whatever remained long since consumed by time and vermin.

A stone foo dog guards the entrance to the building next door, one of a traditional pair. Its partner is missing—vandalism or theft or the entropy that claims unattended things. The remaining lion maintains its post, carved stone in the stylized form that centuries of tradition established: curled mane, muscular haunches, the ball beneath one paw. Still guarding. Nothing left to guard.`,
