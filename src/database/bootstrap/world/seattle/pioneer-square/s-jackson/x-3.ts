  description: `Occidental Avenue intersects S. Jackson Street at the southern terminus of the pedestrian mall, cobblestones cracked and heaved ending where vehicular traffic once resumed. The maple trees that line Occidental's pedestrian stretch are visible to the north, overgrown and wild, their branches forming a canopy over emptiness.

King Street Station rises to the south, its clock tower—modeled on the campanile in Venice's Piazza San Marco—visible above surrounding buildings. The station served Amtrak and Sounder commuter rail, the transit hub where regional and national networks connected. The tower's four clock faces are stopped at different times, massive hands frozen when the power failed. No trains. No commuters. The Venetian campanile it emulated survived centuries. This one may outlast the memory of Venice itself.

PIKE PLACE FLOWERS occupied the corner building, its refrigerated display cases dark and empty. The florist served foot traffic that no longer exists—commuters grabbing bouquets for home, weddings and funerals generating event trade. The flowers are long dead. The coolers that extended cut flower life hold nothing. The weddings ended. The funerals, eventually, ended too.`,
