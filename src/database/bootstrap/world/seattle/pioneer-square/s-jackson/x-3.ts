  description: `Occidental Avenue crosses S. Jackson Street at the southern edge of its pedestrian mall. The maple trees that line the mall are visible to the north, their branches forming a canopy over the cobblestones.

The King Street Station is visible to the south, its clock tower rising above the surrounding buildings. The clock still keeps time, wound by some mechanism that doesn't require people. The trains stopped running. The clock persists.

A flower shop occupied the corner here, its buckets empty, its coolers dark. The flowers that brightened this intersection are gone, their petals scattered, their colors faded to memory.

The intersection is clear. Occidental runs north to the mall and south toward the stadiums. S. Jackson continues east and west.`,
