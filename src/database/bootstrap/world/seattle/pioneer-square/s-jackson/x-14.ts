  description: `The street climbs away from the waterfront through what was once the maritime industrial district. Warehouses and shipping offices and businesses that served the port. The port is quiet. The businesses are empty.

A ship chandler's shop occupies the ground floor, its window displaying rope and chain and nautical supplies. Life jackets hang from hooks. Anchors rust on the floor. The ships that needed these things no longer need anything.

Across the street, a warehouse with a painted sign advertising cold storage. The storage is no longer cold. The contents are better left uninvestigated.`,
