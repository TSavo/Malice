  description: `Jackson Street approaches the International District's heart here, the architecture shifting decisively toward the lower, denser buildings that characterized Chinatown and Japantown before the war. The bilingual signage becomes dominant—Chinese characters, Japanese kanji, Vietnamese words layered over decades of immigrant commerce.

The condemned block is visible to the south, its toxic perimeter running parallel to the street. This close to the contamination, the air sometimes carries a faint chemical tang, especially on hot days when whatever soaked into the ground releases its ghosts. Most people hurry through this stretch.

A traditional herbalist shop occupies one corner, its windows still displaying the ceramic jars and dried specimens that once drew customers seeking remedies not found in Western pharmacies. The jars remain, their contents long since desiccated or decayed, a museum of traditional medicine that no one curates.`,
