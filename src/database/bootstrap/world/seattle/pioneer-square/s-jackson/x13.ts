  description: `A karaoke bar occupies the basement of one building, its entrance a narrow stairway leading down. The neon sign above the stairs advertises PRIVATE ROOMS and THOUSANDS OF SONGS. The songs are silent now. The privacy is absolute.

The stairway descends into darkness. The door at the bottom is closed. The microphones inside wait for voices that will never sing "My Way" or "Sweet Caroline" again.

Across the street, a jewelry store specializes in jade and gold, the traditional investments of a community that trusted precious things more than paper. The jade remains, green and patient in its cases.`,
