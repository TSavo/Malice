  description: `A karaoke bar occupies the basement level of one building, its entrance a narrow stairway descending into darkness. Neon signage above the stairs is dead: PRIVATE ROOMS • THOUSANDS OF SONGS • OPEN LATE. The private rooms below provided controlled environments where groups could sing without performance anxiety. The singing stopped fifty-five years ago. The songs remain, thousands of them on servers that haven't powered on since the war.

The building's ground floor houses JADE PALACE JEWELERS, its security gate pulled down and locked. The shop specialized in jade and gold that Chinese communities traditionally valued. The inventory is probably still inside—jade bangles arranged by shade, gold chains and pendants, the 24-karat pieces that Asian buyers preferred. Looters took electronics and food. They left the traditional financial instruments of immigrant communities, the portable wealth that no longer means anything.

The buildings along this block maintain the International District's characteristic density, narrow facades packed with signage in multiple languages—all faded, all dark. Fire escapes climb exterior walls, rusted to orange-brown, the iron platforms providing emergency egress from residential units whose residents are fifty-five years gone.`,
