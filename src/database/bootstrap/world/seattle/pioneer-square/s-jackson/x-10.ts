  description: `First Avenue is just ahead, its intersection marking the edge of the waterfront district. The buildings grow more urban here, less industrial, their purposes shifting from shipping to commerce.

A coffee roasting facility occupies one building, its industrial equipment visible through large windows. The roasters are cold. The beans are stale. The smell of fresh coffee is a memory shared by those who remember when mornings had routines.

A mural covers the side of the building opposite, depicting the history of Seattle's waterfront. Longshore workers and fishing boats and container ships. The history has ended. The mural continues, telling a story that stopped mid-sentence.`,
