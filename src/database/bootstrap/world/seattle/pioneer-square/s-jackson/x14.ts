  description: `Fourth Avenue is just ahead, marking the eastern edge of Pioneer Square's influence. The International District continues beyond, deeper into its own geography, its own silence.

A tea shop occupies the corner, its window displaying ceramic pots and bamboo implements. The tools of a ceremony that required patience and precision and time. Time has expanded. The patience is untested. The ceremony awaits practitioners.

A stone lion guards the entrance, its partner on the opposite side. Unlike so many pairs in this city, both lions remain, facing outward, protecting a shop that needs no protection from threats that don't come this way.`,
