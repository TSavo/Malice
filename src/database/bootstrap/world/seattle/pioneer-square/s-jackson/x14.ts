  description: `Fourth Avenue intersects S. Jackson Street beneath the Chinatown Gate, the ceremonial arch weathered and faded but still standing. The gate is traditional pagoda style: curved eaves, columns that were red and are now rust-pink, golden Chinese characters that declare welcome in a language that survived dynasties and emigrations—only to find no one left to welcome. The structure was built in the 1970s to announce the community's presence. The community is scattered. The announcement reaches no one.

The Central Link light rail runs above the intersection on elevated tracks, the transit infrastructure silent and still. The trains that connected the International District to Sea-Tac Airport, Capitol Hill, the University haven't run in fifty-five years. The station entrance is nearby, escalators frozen mid-step descending to platforms in darkness. The node in the regional transit network connects nothing to nothing.

CATHAY BANK occupies the corner building, its windows dark, its vault presumably still sealed. The bank processed remittances, maintained savings accounts, provided financial services the neighborhood required. The signage includes Chinese characters alongside English, marking clientele that scattered or died when the war came. The remittances stopped. The savings are numbers on computers that no longer run.`,
