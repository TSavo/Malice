  description: `Fourth Avenue intersects S. Jackson Street at what was once the ceremonial entrance to Chinatown. The gate is down—the traditional pagoda-style arch collapsed across Jackson Street, red columns splintered, curved eaves shattered on the pavement. The golden Chinese characters that declared welcome lie half-buried in debris. The structure was built in the 1970s to announce the community's presence. The community is scattered. The gate is rubble.

Beyond the wreckage, Jackson Street is impassable. The gate's collapse triggered a chain reaction—the building behind it partially gave way, spilling brick and concrete into the road. Passage east is blocked.

The Central Link light rail runs above on elevated tracks, silent and still. The trains that connected the International District to Sea-Tac and Capitol Hill haven't run in fifty-five years. The station entrance is nearby, escalators frozen mid-step descending to platforms in darkness.

CATHAY BANK occupies the corner building, its windows dark. This is as far east as Jackson Street goes. The International District lies beyond the barricade, unreachable from here.`,
