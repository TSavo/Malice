// S. Jackson St - approaching 4th Ave

  description: `Fourth Avenue approaches from the east, the intersection ahead marking what was the ceremonial entrance to the International District—the Chinatown Gate visible in the distance, its pagoda-style arch faded and weathered. This block represents the neighborhood's eastern boundary, the transition zone between historic districts that are equally abandoned.

DRAGON WELL TEA occupies a corner space, its windows dusty, its interior dark. The specialty shop served connoisseurs who appreciated quality Chinese tea. The window display still shows the implements: yixing clay teapots in various sizes, porcelain gaiwans for gongfu brewing, bamboo tea trays. The interior arranged for education as much as retail—a demonstration table where the owner conducted tastings. No tastings now. No connoisseurs. The differences between green and oolong and pu-erh matter only to whoever remembers them.

A pair of stone foo dogs flank the shop's entrance, carved granite in the protective posture that centuries of tradition prescribed. Both lions remain intact, still guarding, their investment in proper feng shui as meaningless now as everything else. The threshold they protect leads to a shop that will never reopen.`,
