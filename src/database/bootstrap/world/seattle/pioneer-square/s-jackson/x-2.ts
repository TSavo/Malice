  description: `The street passes beneath the shadow of taller buildings here, office towers that catered to the government and legal workers from the courthouse district. The workers are gone. The towers remain, their windows dark, their lobbies empty.

A food cart pod occupied this corner once, a collection of trucks selling everything from tacos to Thai food. The trucks are gone, driven away or abandoned, their propane tanks empty, their griddles cold. Only the painted parking spaces remain, outlines of commerce.

A newspaper box displays a headline about something that happened before. The headline is faded. The something has been superseded by everything.`,
