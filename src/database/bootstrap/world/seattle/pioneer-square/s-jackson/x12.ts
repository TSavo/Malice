  description: `A Vietnamese grocery occupies the corner, its shelves still stocked with things that came from far away. Fish sauce and rice paper and noodles in packages with labels that tell stories of distant kitchens. The imports have stopped. The inventory persists.

The smell inside is faint now, the sharp tang of fermentation fading to dust. The vegetables in the cooler have long since turned. The dry goods endure, patient and preserved.

A shrine to Quan Am sits in the corner of the shop, its incense cold, its offerings untended. The bodhisattva of compassion looks out at an empty store with infinite patience.`,
