  description: `A Vietnamese grocery occupies the corner building, its produce bins empty and rusted under a tattered awning. The storefront displays the visual vocabulary of Vietnamese retail frozen in abandonment: the store name painted in Vietnamese script with English translation below, both faded but legible. Through the grimy window: narrow aisles still packed with inventory—the dried goods that outlasted everything perishable, organizational logic preserving products no one will buy.

The interior layout follows the pattern common to immigrant groceries: where fresh produce stood near the entrance, only empty bins remain. Dry goods on ceiling-high shelving have outlasted their expiration by decades. The refrigerated cases along the back wall are dark and warm, whatever perishables they held long since rotted to nothing. A small altar occupies a high shelf near the register—a statue of Quan Am, the bodhisattva of compassion, still watching over a business that will never reopen. The incense holder is empty. No offerings for fifty-five years.

The buildings along this stretch are uniformly two-story, the scale preserved even as the community that built them scattered. The facades show accumulated modifications of decades, then accumulated decay of decades more.`,
