  description: `The street enters the International District proper here, its character shifting with every storefront. Chinese groceries and Vietnamese bakeries and Japanese restaurants, a collection of cultures that found common ground in this corner of Seattle.

A produce market occupies the corner, its bins empty, its awning faded. The bins once held bok choy and daikon and bitter melon and vegetables that required explanation for some customers. The explanations are no longer needed.

A red paper dragon hangs in the window of the building next door, its scales dusty and its eyes bright. Dragons are symbols of power and good fortune. This one guards an empty room.`,
