  description: `S. Jackson enters the International District proper here, the streetscape shifting from Pioneer Square's Victorian decay to the eclectic storefronts of Seattle's Chinatown, equally decayed. The buildings are older—early twentieth century construction adapted over decades to serve immigrant communities from China, Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines. The communities are scattered now, the adaptations frozen in place.

VIET WAH PRODUCE occupies the corner building, its windows grimy, its awning—green canvas printed with Vietnamese and English—tattered and faded. The display bins that held bok choy and bitter melon are empty and rusted. Through the window: stacked bags of jasmine rice collapsed and rotted, shelving lined with fish sauce and coconut milk bottles dusty and expired decades ago. The inventory of immigrant foodways, preserved like a museum exhibit no one visits.

The building next door houses a cultural association, its second-floor windows displaying Chinese characters that identify the organization—a family name association, one of the tongs that provided mutual aid for early immigrants. The families are gone now, scattered or dead. The ground floor's souvenir shop catered to tourists who visited before tourism ended. The souvenirs wait behind dusty glass for tourists who will never come.`,
