  description: `Jackson Street levels out here, the grade from the waterfront having finally eased. The buildings on either side are solidly Pioneer Square—brick facades, arched windows, the ornamental vocabulary of the 1890s reconstruction. They were built after the Great Fire, designed to resist another conflagration. They've resisted everything since.

An iron awning extends from one building, its scrollwork still elegant despite rust and neglect. The awning once sheltered shoppers from Seattle's rain, a courtesy that retailers provided as a matter of course. The courtesy continues, unprovided, unacknowledged—rain still falling, awning still blocking it, no one underneath to appreciate either.

The street narrows slightly where buildings were extended over the sidewalk in the early 1900s, second floors cantilevered to add square footage. The extensions create a canyon effect, buildings leaning toward each other overhead.`,
