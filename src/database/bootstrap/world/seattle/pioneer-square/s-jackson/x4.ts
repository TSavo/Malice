  description: `The Corp Construction zone begins here, its black fabric barriers blocking the view of whatever is happening inside. The zone extends for blocks, a corporate secret that the corporation can no longer protect.

Warning signs are posted at intervals, their threats empty. AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. There are no authorized personnel. There are no personnel at all.

A gap in the fence has been cut, the chain-link peeled back like a wound. Someone wanted to see what was inside. Whether they found it, or it found them, is unclear. The gap remains, an invitation and a warning.`,
