  description: `S. Jackson climbs eastward from the waterfront through what was the maritime supply district, where ship chandlers and marine equipment dealers clustered near the working port. The buildings here are functional—concrete and corrugated metal, roll-up doors rusted shut or hanging open, the architecture of logistics left to decay.

PUGET SOUND MARINE SUPPLY occupies the ground floor of a two-story building, its windows grimy, its door barricaded from inside. The business served the commercial fishing fleet and recreational boaters who needed rope, chain, navigation equipment. The window display still shows inventory—coils of manila and synthetic line, galvanized shackles and cleats—the marine hardware sitting exactly where it was arranged fifty-five years ago. No boats. No fleet. No one needing rope or chain.

A cold storage warehouse dominates the opposite side of the street, its windowless facade broken only by loading docks and massive doors rusted shut. SEATTLE COLD STORAGE is painted on the building in faded blue letters, the name barely legible. The cold chain infrastructure that kept Pacific seafood fresh between boat and plate. The boats stopped coming. The plates are empty. The cold storage is warm now, whatever it contained long since rotted to nothing.`,
