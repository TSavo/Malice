  description: `The buildings here are a mix of old brick and new construction, the neighborhood caught mid-transition when the transitions stopped. A condo development rises on one side, its units partially finished, its cranes frozen in place.

The cranes are still there, their cables hanging slack, their operators' cabs empty. Someone painted "SORRY" on one of the crane's arms in letters large enough to read from the street. It's unclear who was apologizing, or for what.

Across the street, a building from the 1920s maintains its dignity, its brick facade weathered but intact. The old buildings have seen worse. They're used to waiting.`,
