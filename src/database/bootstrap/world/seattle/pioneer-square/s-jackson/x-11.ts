  description: `Hing Hay Park opens to the south, the neighborhood's central gathering space overgrown and silent. The park's pagoda pavilion—a gift from Taipei commemorating the sister city relationship—rises above the surrounding rooflines, its curved eaves weathered, its red-painted columns faded to rust-pink. Chinese architectural vocabulary in an American city, both traditions ending in the same abandonment.

SUN MAY COMPANY occupies the corner building, its windows dark, its door hanging ajar. The pharmacy bridged Western and traditional Chinese medicine—one side displaying American pharmaceuticals long expired, the other showing wooden drawers and glass jars of Chinese herbal remedies dried to dust. The herbs stored in specific ways, the scales for measuring doses, the mortar and pestle for grinding compounds—all still arranged for practitioners who will never return.

The building's upper floors hold apartments, their windows fitted with security bars that protected nothing when it mattered. Fire escapes climb the exterior, rusted to deep orange-brown, the iron platforms unsafe now for emergency egress or anything else. The small apartments they served are dark and empty, the outdoor space they provided overlooking only decay.`,
