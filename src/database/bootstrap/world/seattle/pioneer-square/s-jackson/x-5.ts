  description: `The streetscape intensifies here, storefronts crowded together in the dense commercial pattern that Asian urban neighborhoods favored. The buildings are narrow but deep, their facades packed with signage in Chinese, Vietnamese, and English—faded now, the visual density reflecting cultural mixing that no longer mixes. The International District defined by its internationalism, now defined by its emptiness.

JADE NOODLE HOUSE occupies a ground-floor space, its kitchen visible through a pass-through window designed to showcase noodle-making. Hand-pulled noodles required performance as much as skill, dough stretched and folded in rhythms customers watched. The pass-through frames only dust and darkness now. The wok stations along the back wall are cold, the high-BTU burners silent, the industrial ventilation still as a held breath. No one makes noodles. No one watches.

Decorative wire spans the street overhead at intervals, the infrastructure that supported festival lighting during Lunar New Year. Paper lanterns once transformed the streetscape. The wire remains, holding nothing, the festivals fifty-five years past. The cultural identity the neighborhood maintained is memory now, and fading.`,
