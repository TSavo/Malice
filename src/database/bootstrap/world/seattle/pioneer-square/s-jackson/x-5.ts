  description: `Union Station is visible to the south, its Beaux-Arts facade weathered but intact, the grandeur that early twentieth-century rail terminals demanded surviving what came after. The station opened in 1911, designed by Reed & Stem—the same architects who created New York's Grand Central Terminal. Grand Central is probably rubble now. Union Station still stands, its ornate windows dark, its grand hall empty.

The ground floor of the adjacent building housed DESC—the Downtown Emergency Service Center—one of the social service organizations that clustered in this transitional zone. The organization provided housing and services to people experiencing homelessness. The intake windows are shuttered now, the waiting rooms empty. Everyone experienced homelessness when the war came. The services ended. The need became universal and unmet.

A mural spans the wall opposite, a public art commission depicting Seattle's railroad heritage. Workers driving spikes, locomotives pulling into stations—the iconography of the railroad era when Seattle was the terminus of the Great Northern Railway. The paint has faded and peeled, the railroad heritage becoming as distant as the rails themselves, rusting to nothing on rights-of-way no train will ever use again.`,
