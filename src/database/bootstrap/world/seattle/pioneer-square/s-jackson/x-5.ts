  description: `A community bulletin board stands at the corner, protected by glass that someone has cracked but not shattered. The notices inside are in multiple languages, announcing events and services and opportunities that no longer exist.

A noodle shop occupies the ground floor, its kitchen visible through a pass-through window. The woks are cold. The noodles have dried. The steam that once fogged the windows has dissipated, leaving clear glass and an empty kitchen.

Red lanterns string across the street here, connecting buildings on opposite sides. Some have fallen. Others persist, their paper torn, their light extinguished, their luck exhausted.`,
