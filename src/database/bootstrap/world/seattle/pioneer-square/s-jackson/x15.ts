  description: `Fourth Avenue crosses S. Jackson Street at a gateway into the International District. A pagoda-style arch spans the street, its red paint bright, its golden characters declaring something hopeful in a language that outlasted the hope.

The light rail runs above the intersection here, its elevated tracks casting shadows on the street below. The trains are silent. The shadows remain, marking the passage of a transit system that no longer transits.

A bank building anchors the corner, its ATMs dark, its vault closed. The bank served the community, held its savings, processed its remittances. The savings are still there. The remittances have stopped.

The intersection is clear. Fourth Avenue runs north and south. S. Jackson ends here at the heart of the International District.`,
