  description: `Second Avenue crosses S. Jackson Street at the main pedestrian approach to the stadiums. The crosswalks are painted in team colors, faded now but still visible, guiding nonexistent crowds to games that will never be played.

A light rail station entrance descends into the earth nearby, its escalators frozen, its platform empty. The station connected the stadiums to the rest of the city. The connections have been severed. The station waits underground.

A hot dog stand occupied this corner on game days, its umbrella bright, its onions fragrant. The stand is gone. The smell of game-day food is a memory shared by no one present.

The intersection is clear. Second Avenue runs north and south. S. Jackson continues east and west.`,
