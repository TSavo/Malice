  description: `The construction fence continues along the south side of the street, its black fabric opaque and mysterious. Whatever Corp was building here, they were serious about keeping it private. They succeeded. Even now, with no one to enforce the privacy, the secret is kept.

A convenience store on the north side served the construction workers who aren't here anymore. Energy drinks and cigarettes and lottery tickets. The workers are gone. The inventory remains, a snapshot of blue-collar consumption.

A porta-potty stands at the corner, locked and possibly occupied. No one has checked. No one wants to check.`,
