  description: `A temple occupies the second floor of one building, its entrance marked by a narrow stairway and a sign in Chinese characters. The incense that burned here is long cold. The prayers that were offered have gone unanswered, or perhaps answered in ways that weren't expected.

A bubble tea shop occupies the ground floor, its menu of improbable flavors still posted on the wall. Taro and lychee and things that required an adventurous palate. The tapioca pearls have long since dissolved. The adventures are over.

The street is quiet in the particular way of places that were once loud with multiple languages.`,
