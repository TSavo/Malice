  description: `The railroad tracks cross the street here, rusted rails running north and south along the waterfront. The trains carried freight from the port to destinations across the country. The freight has stopped moving. The destinations have stopped receiving.

A crossing gate stands permanently lowered, its red lights dark, its bells silent. The gate blocks nothing from nothing, a barrier that serves no purpose but refuses to retire.

A faded sign warns of the tracks: LOOK OUT FOR TRAINS. The trains are not coming. The looking out continues anyway, a habit of caution.`,
