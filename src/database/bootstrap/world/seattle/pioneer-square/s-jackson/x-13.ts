  description: `The BNSF Railway mainline crosses S. Jackson Street here, the tracks rusted orange from decades without trains, the rails that once connected port terminals to the transcontinental network. The crossing gates are locked in the upright position, their striped arms faded, signal lights dark. The concrete pad is cracked and heaved, weeds pushing through the joints.

The tracks themselves are heavy rail, the 136-pound continuous welded rail that modern freight operations required. The ballast has been colonized by vegetation, weeds and small trees growing between the rails, the railroad right-of-way becoming a corridor of accidental wilderness. No trains have passed here in fifty-five years. The vibration and noise that railroad-adjacent construction was designed to withstand has been replaced by silence.

Buildings crowd up to the edge of the right-of-way on both sides, their walls still darkened by diesel soot from the days when trains ran. A warehouse on the south side shows its windows broken, its loading docks empty, the freight that once moved through here stopped moving when everything stopped.`,
