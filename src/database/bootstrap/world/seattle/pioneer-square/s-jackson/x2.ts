// S. Jackson St - approaching 2nd Ave

  description: `Second Avenue is just ahead, its intersection busy with nothing. The street here served as the main approach to the stadiums, wide enough for the crowds that surged toward games and concerts and events. The width seems excessive now.

A memorabilia shop sold jerseys and caps and foam fingers, the uniform of fandom. The shop is dark. The merchandise remains, sized for fans who have vanished, in colors of teams that no longer play.

A bronze statue of a baseball player stands outside, frozen in mid-swing. The player it commemorates is probably dead. The statue persists, swinging at a pitch that will never arrive.`,
