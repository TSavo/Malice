  description: `The Corp Construction perimeter continues along the south side of S. Jackson, black fabric barriers maintained and patrolled, the visual wall separating the active site from the dead city beyond. The fence runs for three blocks, the footprint suggesting the scale of whatever Corp is building. Tower cranes move above the barriers—actually move, their arms swinging in ways no other machinery in this district has moved in fifty-five years.

LUCKY MART occupies the ground floor opposite, a convenience store that served the neighborhood before the war. The awning—red canvas printed with English and Vietnamese—is faded and torn, the sidewalk produce display empty and rusted. Through the grimy window: coolers along the back wall dark and dead, snack aisles picked clean decades ago, the lottery terminal behind the counter offering jackpots no one will ever claim.

The buildings along this stretch show the International District's characteristic mix, equally abandoned: older brick structures adapted for uses that ended, newer construction built to codes that no longer matter. The residential character the block maintained is silent now, apartments above dark retail housing no one. The community that gave the neighborhood its identity is gone, while Corp builds something new in its ruins.`,
