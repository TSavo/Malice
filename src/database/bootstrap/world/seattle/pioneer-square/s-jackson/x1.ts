  description: `A parking structure rises on the south side of the street, multiple levels of poured concrete built to accommodate event-day demand. The structure is massive—helical ramps climbing through darkness, open sides no longer ventilating anything. The capacity suggested the crowds that baseball and football generated: tens of thousands of people requiring parking. The parking spaces are empty. A few vehicles remain scattered through the levels, abandoned when their owners fled or died, tires flat, batteries long dead.

Rate signs near the entrance list event pricing and monthly permits—the economics that made it work before economics stopped working. The upper levels still offer views across the stadium district and toward Elliott Bay, the panorama that Seattle's topography provides to no one who climbs to see it.

The buildings across the street are older, two- and three-story structures that predate the stadium era. A print shop occupies one ground floor, STADIUM GRAPHICS according to faded window signage. The business served the sports industry's constant need for promotional materials—banners, signs, the printed matter that marketing departments consumed. No more sports. No more industry. No more promotional materials needed.`,
