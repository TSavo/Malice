  description: `A parking structure rises on the south side of the street, built to accommodate the stadium crowds that no longer come. Thousands of spaces, all empty, all paid for by public bonds that will never be repaid. The structure is a monument to optimism and bad financial planning.

The upper levels offer views of the stadiums and the waterfront and a city that looks almost normal from a distance. Up close, the emptiness is harder to ignore. Distance helps.

A pay station stands at the entrance, its screen displaying rates that seem quaint. The rates assume people. The people have been discontinued.`,
