  description: `The street enters the heart of the International District here, its identity clear and distinct. Red lanterns and Chinese characters and the architectural flourishes of a neighborhood that maintained its character against gentrification. The character remains. The gentrification has stopped.

A dim sum restaurant occupies the corner, its rolling carts visible through the window, its bamboo steamers stacked on shelves. The carts are empty. The steamers are cold. The recipes are memories held by no one present.

A pay phone stands at the corner, its receiver dangling, its cord twisted. The phone still works, probably. No one is calling.`,
