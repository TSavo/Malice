  description: `The stadiums are visible to the south, their massive structures dominating the skyline. Baseball and football, the civic religions of America, played in temples of concrete and steel. The games have stopped. The temples remain, monuments to entertainments that required crowds.

A sports bar occupies the corner, its windows decorated with team logos and pennants. The TVs inside are dark. The beer taps are dry. The crowds that gathered here on game days have dispersed to wherever crowds go when games end permanently.

A ticket scalper's spot near the entrance is marked by nothing but memory. The scalpers knew their corners. The corners have forgotten them.`,
