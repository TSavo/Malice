  description: `The stadium district rises to the south, T-Mobile Park and Lumen Field dominating the skyline with the scale that professional sports facilities require. The two stadiums were built in the late 1990s, replacing the Kingdome. The corporate names are probably meaningless now—T-Mobile and Lumen gone the way of everything else—but the signs remain, advertising companies that no longer exist to crowds that will never gather.

SLUGGERS SPORTS BAR occupies the corner building, its windows plastered with team decals faded to ghosts. Through the grimy glass: multiple television screens dark and dead, a long bar backed by beer taps rusted in place, sports memorabilia gathering dust on walls no one looks at. The business model depended on event-day traffic. The events ended. The traffic stopped. The bar serves no one.

The streetscape was designed for pedestrian flow—wide sidewalks and clear sightlines guiding thousands of fans on game days. The infrastructure of crowd management remains: signal poles dark and rusting, curb cuts and crosswalks faded. The predictable patterns accommodated masses of people moving together. No masses. No patterns. Just the silence of spaces designed for noise.`,
