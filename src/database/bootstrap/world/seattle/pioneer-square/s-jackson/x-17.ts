  description: `The streetscape captures the neighborhood mid-transition, frozen at whatever stage it had reached when the war came. A tower crane rises from a construction site on the north side of the street, its latticed arm rusted and motionless, extending over a partially completed structure—concrete floors poured, exterior cladding only partially installed. JACKSON PLACE, according to signage on the construction fence. Luxury condominiums with views of Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains. The views are still there. No one will ever live here.

The construction fence itself is plywood painted with architectural renderings: happy residents on rooftop decks, a fitness center with floor-to-ceiling windows, the amenities that Seattle's real estate market demanded before it stopped demanding anything. The renderings have faded and peeled, the happy residents ghostly. Behind the fence, the structure rises eight stories, its exposed concrete and protruding rebar suggesting a building caught between foundation and finish, forever incomplete.

Across the street, a 1920s commercial building maintains its brick facade with the confidence of structures that have already survived one century. The ground floor held retail—a frame shop, a dry cleaner—their windows dark, their services ended. The building survived the century. It will survive the next one, empty.`,
