  description: `Third Avenue crosses S. Jackson Street at the eastern boundary of the Corp Construction zone. The fence ends here, its mystery contained, its secrets kept behind black fabric that reveals nothing.

The International District stretches to the east, its character asserting itself in signage and architecture. The transition is abrupt, construction zone giving way to established neighborhood, mystery yielding to familiarity.

A bus station occupies the corner, its shelters empty, its schedules outdated. The buses came through here on their way to everywhere. Everywhere has been cancelled. The shelters remain, sheltering nothing.

The intersection is clear. Third Avenue runs north and south. S. Jackson continues east and west.`,
