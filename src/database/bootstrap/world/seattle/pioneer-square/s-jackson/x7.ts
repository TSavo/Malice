  description: `The construction fence angles here, following property lines that made sense on blueprints. The angle creates a small plaza, an accidental public space where the fence meets the sidewalk.

Someone has set up a shrine in the plaza. Candles and flowers and photographs of people who were loved. The shrine has been maintained, which means someone is still here, still remembering, still placing fresh flowers among the wilted ones.

The photographs show faces that smile at a camera that clicked before everything clicked off. The faces are young and old and beautiful and ordinary. They were someone's something. Now they're laminated and leaning against a construction fence.`,
