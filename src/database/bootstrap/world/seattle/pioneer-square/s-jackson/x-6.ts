  description: `The Hing Hay Park is visible to the south, its pagoda pavilion rising above the surrounding buildings. The pavilion was a gift from Taipei, a symbol of sister city friendship. The friendship persists, theoretically, across an ocean that neither city can cross anymore.

Dried herbs hang in bundles in the window, their medicinal properties intact even if the people who understood them are gone. The herbs wait, patient and aromatic.`,
