  description: `Jackson Street climbs from the waterfront into Pioneer Square, the grade steeper here than on the parallel streets. The hill made this corridor less desirable for commerce in the early days, before the streets were graded and sidewalks installed. The grading helped, but the incline remains, a reminder that Seattle was built on hills that refused to flatten entirely.

The sinkhole dominates the view to the south, its flooded crater visible between the buildings. The collapse took part of the street grid with it, isolating this stretch from the blocks below. The isolation has made the area quieter, traffic routing around rather than through.

A rusted pickup truck sits at the curb, its tires flat, its bed filled with rainwater and debris. The truck has been here for decades, becoming part of the landscape, a landmark that no one chose but everyone recognizes.`,
