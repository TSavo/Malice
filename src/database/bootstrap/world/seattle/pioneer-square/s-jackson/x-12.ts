  description: `A viaduct once passed overhead here, carrying traffic above the surface streets. The viaduct is gone, torn down before everything else was torn down, leaving behind a wide corridor of sky where concrete used to be.

The absence feels strange, an empty space that should contain something. The city planned to build a park here. The park was never built. The emptiness remains, neither viaduct nor park, just space.

A homeless encampment occupied this spot for a while. The tents are gone but the evidence remains: scorch marks from fires, scattered belongings, the geography of survival.`,
