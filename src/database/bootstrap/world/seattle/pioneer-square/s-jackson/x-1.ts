  description: `Union Station is visible to the south, its grand Beaux-Arts facade a reminder of when trains were romantic and travel was an event. The station was converted to offices before everything was converted to emptiness. The facade remains, promising arrivals that will never happen.

A homeless services office occupies the ground floor of one building, its intake window dark, its waiting room empty. The people who needed services still need them. The services are no longer available.

A mural on the wall depicts Seattle's railroad history. Workers and locomotives and the promise of connection. The connections have been severed. The mural continues its celebration.`,
