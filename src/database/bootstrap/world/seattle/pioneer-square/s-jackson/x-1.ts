  description: `Jackson Street passes through the heart of Pioneer Square's southern commercial district here, the buildings rising to their maximum heights as the street approaches Second Avenue. Six-story brick structures line both sides, their upper floors marked by rows of windows that once lit offices and workshops. The windows are dark now, the offices empty, but the structures remain sound.

The condemned block is visible to the south, its perimeter of warning signs marking where the street grid becomes impassable. The contamination—whatever it was—seeped north during the early years, staining the pavement near this intersection. The stains have faded but not disappeared, a reminder of proximities that should be avoided.

A street corner that once hosted a flower vendor's cart shows the wear pattern of commerce—smoothed concrete where feet gathered, a cleared rectangle where the cart itself stood. The flowers are gone. The vendor is gone. The worn concrete remembers.`,
