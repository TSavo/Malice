A community center occupies one building, its bulletin board covered with announcements in multiple languages. ESL classes and cultural events and social services. The services have been discontinued. The announcements remain, promising help that can't be delivered.

A mural covers one wall, depicting scenes from the neighborhood's history. Immigration and discrimination and resilience. The resilience continues, painted and permanent.`,
