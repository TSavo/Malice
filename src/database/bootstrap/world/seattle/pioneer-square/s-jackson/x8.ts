// S. Jackson St - approaching 3rd Ave

  description: `Third Avenue approaches from the east, the intersection marking the boundary where the Corp Construction zone ends and the International District's abandoned streetscape resumes. The construction barriers terminate at the property line—Corp's maintained perimeter meeting buildings Corp didn't buy, the contrast between active development and decay sharper here than anywhere.

PACIFIC RIM CURRENCY EXCHANGE occupies the corner building, its windows dark, its services obsolete. Currency exchanges clustered in immigrant neighborhoods, providing the service families needed to send money home. The window still displays exchange rates in columned format: USD to JPY, USD to PHP, USD to VND—currencies that may not exist anymore, exchange rates frozen when the markets stopped. The families that sent money home are scattered. Home, for most of them, is gone.

Security cameras are mounted at the building's corners, their weatherproof housings intact, their lenses pointed at nothing. The coverage they provided protected against theft and vandalism. The war was neither theft nor vandalism. The cameras recorded nothing useful.`,
