  description: `Third Avenue is just ahead, its intersection marking the eastern edge of the Corp Construction zone. Whatever they were building inside, it doesn't extend past Third Avenue. The mystery has boundaries.

A currency exchange occupies the corner, its rates posted in the window. Dollars to yen, euros to pesos, everything to everything else. The exchange rates are frozen at some moment when exchange still mattered. They don't matter now. Nothing exchanges for anything.

A security camera points at the street from the exchange's facade, its lens dusty, its recordings unseen. It captured everything and nothing watches.`,
