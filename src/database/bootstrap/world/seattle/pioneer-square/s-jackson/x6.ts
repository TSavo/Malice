  description: `The Corp Construction perimeter continues unbroken here, black fabric barriers maintained and crisp against the decay opposite. Whatever rises within remains invisible from street level—the tower cranes suggesting something substantial, their movement a jarring contrast to the stillness everywhere else. Corporate mystery in a city with no one left to wonder.

SUPER CLEAN LAUNDROMAT occupies a ground-floor space opposite, its plate glass window intact but grimy. Through the glass: rows of front-loading washers and stackable dryers standing silent, the industrial equipment that coin-operated laundries required. The machines are dead, their coin slots accepting currency that no longer exists. A counter in back suggests wash-and-fold service no one needs—nothing left to wash, no one to fold it for.

The buildings along this stretch maintain the International District's characteristic scale—two and three stories, ground-floor commercial with residential above, all equally empty. The facades show accumulated adaptations of buildings repurposed over decades, then abandoned. The mix of old structure and new function that characterized urban neighborhoods, frozen when function ended.`,
