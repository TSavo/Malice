  description: `Jackson Street enters the transitional zone between Pioneer Square and the International District here, the architectural styles beginning to blend. Victorian brick gives way to more utilitarian construction, the ornate details of the 1890s replaced by the clean lines of later decades. The transition was always gradual along this corridor.

A former social services office occupies one corner, its windows covered with plywood that someone painted with a mural years ago. The mural depicts a sunrise over mountains—hopeful imagery that feels ironic given what came after. The paint is fading, the plywood rotting, but the sunrise persists in slow decay.

The street is quieter here than at the main intersections, the foot traffic that once flowed between neighborhoods having dried up long ago. The quiet has weight, the absence of commerce leaving a void that silence fills.`,
